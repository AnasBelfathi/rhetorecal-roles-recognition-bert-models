ACT:
Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 (Act XI of 1922), s. 4-Profits
derived by the assessee- Whether arose or were received in
British Indian in the present case.

HEADNOTE:
The assessee company with its registered office in Mysore
State and its management vested in Oakley Bowden Co.
Ltd.,Madras sold Chrome ore to buyers mostly outside India
who were in America and Europe.",PREAMBLE
"The sales to the purchasers
in Europe were put through in London by Borden Oakely and
Co. Ltd., London, the agent of the assessee company in
Europe, the said agent signing the contracts for sale in
London.",PREAMBLE
"The sales to purchasers in America were effected
through W. R. Grace & Co., New, York, who bought for
undisclosed principals, the contracts for sale to American
purchasers being signed by W. R. Grace & Co., Ltd., New
York, in America and by Oakley Bowden & Co. Ltd. (Madras) in
Madras.",PREAMBLE
"Under both forms of contracts with European pur.
chasers and American purchasers the price was F.O.B. Madras.",PREAMBLE
"
Provision was made for weighment, sampling and assay of
goods at destination.",PREAMBLE
"The course of dealing between the
assessee company and the purchasers was as follows:-
",PREAMBLE
"Before the goods were actually shipped, the buyers used to
open a confirmed irrevocable Bankers' credit with some first
class Bank in London.",PREAMBLE
"Being informed of the opening of such
credit theEastern Bank Ltd., London, sent intimation to",PREAMBLE
"the Eastern
Bank Ltd., Madras, and the latter in its turn used to pass
on the intimation by letter addressed to the assesses
company.",PREAMBLE
"On receipt of such intimation the assessee company
placed the contracted goods on board the steamer at Madras
and obtained a bill of lading in its own name.",PREAMBLE
"If hereafter
the assessee company used to make out a provisional invoice
on the basis of the bill of lading weight and contract price
for 48 percent Cr. 203 and used to draw a bill of exchange
on the buyers' Bank, where the letter of credit had been
opened, for 90 percent of the amount of the provisional
invoice payable at sight in the case of European contracts

and 80 percent of the amount of the provisional invoice at
90 days' sight in the case of American contracts end in
either case the bills of exchange used to be drawn in favour
of the Eastern Bank Ltd., London.",PREAMBLE
"The bill of exchange
together with the bill of lading endorsed in blank by the
assessee company and the provisional invoice was then
negotiated with the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, the bankers
of the assesses company, who used to credit the assessee
company with the amount of the bill of exchange.",PREAMBLE
"The
Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, then forwarded the documents to
the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, who used to present the bill
of exchange to the buyers' Bank in London, and upon the bill
of exchange being accepted the Eastern Bank Ltd., London,
used to deliver the bill of lading and the invoice to",PREAMBLE
"the
buyers' Bank",PREAMBLE
". The buyers' Bank in due course used to pay
the amount of the bill of exchange to the Eastern Bank Ltd.,
London.",PREAMBLE
"Thereafter, on arrival of the goods and after
weighment and assay, the sale price was ascertained and the
balance of price after deducting the payments made against
the bill of exchange, used to be paid to the Eastern Bank
Ltd., London, which was the assessee company s agent and
Banker in London.",PREAMBLE
"
It was common ground between the Income-tax department and
assessee company that the income arose at the place where
the sales took place.",PREAMBLE
"
It was contended on behalf of the department that the sales
must be regarded as having taken place in British India
because (i) the price and delivery of goods were on F.O.B.
terms, (ii) that in the European contracts, the insurance,
if any, was to be the concern of the buyers, (iii) that the
payment of the 80 percent or 90 percent as the case may be
was made in Madras by the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, and as
on these facts the property passed at Madras, ,;he sales
were completed in British India.
Held, (repelling the contention) that upon the terms of the
contracts in question and the course of dealings between the
parties ,he property in the goods could not have passed to
the buyer earlier than the date when the bill of exchange
was accepted by the Bank in London and the documents were
delivered by the assesses company's agent, the Eastern Bank
Ltd., London, to the duyers Bank and this admittedly always
took place in London and in the promises the sales took
place outside British India and exhypothesi the profits derived from such sales arose Outside
British India.",PREAMBLE
"
Held further, that the contention submitted on behalf of the
department that irrespective of the place where the sales
may have taken place the profits derived from such sales
were received in Madras, as after shipment the assessee
company, through its managing agent` in Madras, prepared
provisional invoices and drew bills of exchange for 80
percent or 90 percent as the case may be of the amount of
such invoices and handed over the same to the Eastern Bank
Ltd., Madras, and received the amount of the bill of
exchange from them in Madras and that the receipt of this
payment ,by the assessee company was really the receipt of
the price of the goods and amounted to receipt of profits in
Madras, was also devoid of force because the price was paid
on behalf of the buyers by their respective London Banks in
London to the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, which was the agent
of the assessee company.",PREAMBLE
"The first receipt of the price was
by the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, on behalf of the sellers
and the balance of the price ascertained after weighment and
assay and deducting the amount paid on the bill of exchange

was similarly received in London by the Eastern Bank Ltd.,
London, on behalf of the assesses company and subsequent
adjustment made in the books of Eastern Bank Ltd., London,
did not operate as receipt of profits in British India.",PREAMBLE

"The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS J.-This is an appeal from the judgment pronounced by the High Court of Judicature at Madras on the 29th March, 1951, on a consolidated reference by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal under section 66(1) of the Income-tax Act whereby the High Court answered.",PREAMBLE
"in the affirmative both the referred questions which were expressed in the following terms;(1) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the profits derived by the assessee company 'from sales made to European and American buyers arose outside British India ?
(2) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the profits derived by the assessee company from sales made to European and American buyers were received outside British India ?",FAC
"
The above Questions of law arose out of proceedings for the assessment to income-tax of the respondent, Mysore Chromite Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the asseessee company), for the years 1939-1940, 1940 1941, 1941-1942 and 1942-1943.",FAC
"
The facts leading up to the reference as found by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal are shortly as follows: The assessee company is a private limited company registered in the Mysore State under the Mysore Company Regulations and has its registered office at Sinduvalli in Mysore State.",FAC
"The management and control of the assessee company was vested in Messrs. Oakley Bowden & Co. (Madras) Ltd., another private limited company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, having its registered office at No.
15, Armenian Street, Madras.",FAC
The assessee company owns chromite mines in Mysore State.,FAC
Chrome ores are extracted from the mines and converted into a merchantable product and then sold to buyers mostly outside India.,FAC
A very small proportion of the total sales is effected in India and for the purposes of this case may be left out of consideration.,FAC
"
The sales are mostly to buyers in America and Europe.",FAC
"The sales to the purchasers in Europe are put through in London by Bowden Oakley & Co. Ltd., London, which is the agent of the assessee company in Europe holding a power of attorney from the assessee company.",FAC
"The contracts for sale to European purchasers are signed by Bowden Oakley & Co. Ltd., in London.",FAC
"The sales to purchasers in America are effected through Messrs. W. R. Grace & Co., who buy for undisclosed principals.",FAC
"The contracts for sale to American purchasers are signed by W. R. Grace & Co., presumably in America and by Oakley Bowden & Co. (Madras), Ltd., in Madras.",FAC
"Specimen forms of contracts with European purchasers and those with American purchasers are set out in the order of the Tribunal dated the 22nd January,1948, out of which the present reference arises.",FAC
Under both forms of contracts the price was F.C.B. Madras or Marmagoa.,FAC
A very small quantity of goods was sold F.O.B. Marmagoa and the same need not be considered here.,FAC
"Provision was made for weighment, sampling and assay of goods at destination.",FAC
"The terms of payment under the European contract were as follows:- Payment.-Buyers to open a confirmed irrevocable Bankers credit in favour of Messrs. Mysore Chromite Ltd., Madras (to be advised to sellers) through the Eastern Bank Ltd., for 90 per cent.",FAC
(ninety per cent..) of the Provincial (sic) Invoice against documents.,FAC
"Documents to consist of:- 1. Bills of Lading, 2. Provisional Invoice.",FAC
Provisional invoice to be based on Bill of Lading weight and contract price for 48 per cent.,FAC
Cr. 203.,FAC
"Balance on ascertainment of weight and analysis to be paid in London to Bowden Oakley & Co., Ltd., within 10 days of the final invoice, based on outturn weights and assays.",FAC
The corresponding terms of payment under the American contracts were as follows:- Payment.-Letter of credit for eighty per cent.,FAC
(80 per cent.) of invoice value to be available against drafts at ninety (90) days' sight with documents attached to be opened immediately in London in favour of the seller,FAC
". Balance estimated twenty (20 per cent.) of the margin due to be paid by telegraphic transfer through London on receipt of information as to assay and outturn which should be submitted within a month after the arrival of the steamer at destination, Charges for such telegraphic transfer for account of beneficiary.",FAC
The European contracts also provided for insurance by buyers but no such provision was made in the American contracts.854,FAC
The course of dealing as found by the Appellate Tribunal was as follows.,FAC
"Before the goods were actually shipped, the buyers used to open a confirmed irrevocable Bankers' credit with some first class bank in London.",FAC
"Being informed of the opening of such credit the Eastern Bank Ltd., London sent intimation to the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, and the latter in its turn used to pass on the intimation by letter addressed to the' assessee company.",FAC
A specimen of such letter is also set out in the order of the Appellate Tribunal.,FAC
"in such communication the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, informed the assessee company that I 'in accordance with advices received by letter from our London Office, a confirmed and irrevocable credit has been opened in your favour by Messrs. Morgan Grenfell & Co., Ltd., London, for account of Messrs. W. R. Grace & Co., New York, for a sum not exceeding pound. 7,300 (seven thousand three hundred pounds sterling) in all, available by delivery to us on or before 15th January, 1940, of the following documents...............",FAC
"Towards, the end of the letter the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, used to write that they were ""prepared in our options as customary to negotiate drafts drawn in terms of the arrangement provided that the documents as above mentioned appear to us to be in order. """,FAC
"
The letter concluded with a warning that the advice was ""given for your guidance and without involving any rosponsi- bility on the part of this Bank.",FAC
""" On receipt of such intimation the assessee company placed the contracted goods on board the steamer at Madras and obtained A bill of lading in its own name.",FAC
"As already mentioned, the shipments were made principally at Madras Port.",FAC
"Thereafter, the assessee company used to make out a provisional invoice on the basis of the bill of lading weight and contract price for 48 per cent' Cr. 203 and used to draw a bill of exchange on the buyers Bank, where the letter of credit had been opened, for 90 per cent. of the amount of the provisional invoice payable at sight in the case of European contracts and 80 per cent. of the amount of the provisional invoice at 90 days' sight in the case of American contracts and in either case the bills of exchange used to be drawn in favour of theEastern 'Batik Ltd., London.",FAC
"The bill of exchange together with the relative bill of lading endorsed in blank by the assessee company and the provisional invoice was then negotiated with the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, the bankers of the assessee company, Who used to credit the assessee company with the amount of the bill of exchange.",FAC
"The Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, then forwarded the documents to the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, who used to present the bill of exchange to the buyers' Bank in London and upon the bill of exchange being accepted the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, used to deliver the bill of lading and the invoice to the buyers' Bank.",FAC
"The buyers Bank in due course used to pay the amount of the bill of exchange to the Eastern Bank Ltd., London.",FAC
"Thereafter, on arrival of the goods and' after weighment and assay, the sale price was ascertained and the balance of price, after deducting the payments made against the bill of exchange, used to be paid to the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, which was the assessee company's agent and banker in London.",FAC
On the facts stated above the Income-tax Officer assessed the assessee company on the entire profits in respect of these sales on the footing that they arose and were also received in British India.,FAC
"On appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed the assessment.",FAC
The assessee company went up on appeal to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal.,FAC
"The Tribunal by its order dated the 22nd January, 1948, came to the conclusion that the sales took place outside British India and that the money in respect of such sales was also received by the agent of the.
assessee company in London.",FAC
The Commissioner of Income-tax thereupon applied to the Appellate Tribunal requiring the latter to state a case and refer certain questions of law said to &rise out of the order of the Tribunal.,FAC
The Appellate Tribunal accordingly referred the two questions of law hereinbefore set out.,FAC
The High Court of Madras in a well reasoned judgment upheld the decision of the Appellate Tribunal and answered the two questions in the affirmative and against the Commissioner of Income-tax.,FAC
The Commissioner of Income-tax' has now preferredthis appeal with a certificate of fitness from the High Court.,FAC
"
It appears from the statement of case as also from the order of the Appellate Tribunal that it was agreed between the department and the assessee company that the income arose at the place, wherever that be, where, the sales took place.",ANALYSIS
"
This was not disputed before the High Court or before us although in the appellant's statement of case it was suggested that this was erroneous.",ANALYSIS
"The point for determination, therefore, is as to where the sales took place.",ANALYSIS
Learned Solicitor-General appearing in support of this appeal contends that having regard to the terms of the contracts the sales must be regarded as having taken place in British India.,ARG_PETITIONER
"The facts strongly relied on by him are (i) that the price and delivery of goods were on F.O.B.
terms, (ii) that in the European contracts the insurance, if any, was to be the concern of the buyers and (iii) that payment of the 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. as the case may be was made in Madras by the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, to the assessee company on the delivery of the documents.",ARG_PETITIONER
"All these facts taken together indicate, according to his submission, that the property in the goods passed at Madras and the sales accordingly were completed in British India.
",ARG_PETITIONER
We are unable to accept this line of reasoning.,ANALYSIS
"According to section 4 of the Indian Sale of Goods Act a contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfer,% or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a price and where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer, the contract is called a sale, but where the transfer of property in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject to some condition thereafter to be fulfilled, the contract is called an agreement to sell.",STA
By sub-section (4) of that section an agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred.,STA
"
Section 18 of the Act clearly indicates that in the case of sale of unascertained goods no property in the goods is transferred to the buyer unless and until the goods, are ascertained.",STA
"In 857, the present case, the contracts were always for sale of unascertained, goods.",ANALYSIS
"Skipping over sections 19 to 22 which deal with contract of sale of specific goods we come to section 23 which lays down that where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description and goods of that description and in a,, deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer.",ANALYSIS
It is suggested that as soon as the assessee company placed the goods on board the steamer named by the buyer at the Madras Port the goods became ascertained and the property in the goods passed immediately to the buyer.,ANALYSIS
"This argument, however, overlooks the important word ""unconditionally"" used in the section.",ANALYSIS
"
The requirement of the section is not only that there shall be appropriation of the goods to the contract but that such appropriation must be made unconditionally.",ANALYSIS
"This is further elaborated by section 25 which provides that where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods or where goods are subsequently appropriated to the contract, the seller may, by the. terms. of the contract or appropriation,, reserve the right of disposal of the goods until certain conditions are fulfilled.",STA
"In such a case, notwithstanding the delivery of the goods to the buyer, or to a carrier or other bailer for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, the property in the goods does not pass to the buyer until the conditions imposed by the seller are fulfilled.",ANALYSIS
"The question in this case, therefore, is: was there an unconditional appro- priation of the goods by merely placing them on the ship ?",ISSUE
"
It is true that the price and delivery was F.O.B., Madras but the contracts themselves clearly required the buyers to open a confirmed irrevocable Bankers' credit for, the requisite percentage of the invoice value to be available against documents.",ANALYSIS
"This clearly indicated that the buyers would not be entitled to the documents,, that is, the bill of lading and the provisional invoice, until payment of the requisite percentage was made upon the bill of exchange.",ANALYSIS
"
The bill of lading is the document of title to the goods and by this termthe assessee company clearly reserved the right of disposal, of the goods until the bill of exchange *as paid'.'",ANALYSIS
Placing of the goods on board the steamer named by the buyer under a F.O.B. contract clearly discharges the contractual liability of the seller as seller and the delivery to the buyer is complete and the goods may thenceforward be also at the risk of the buyer against which he may cover himself by taking out an insurance.,ANALYSIS
"Prima facie such delivery of the goods to the buyer and the passing of the risk in respect of the goods from the seller to the buyer are strong indications as to the passing also of the property in the goods to the buyer but they are not decisive and may be negatived, for under section 25 the seller may yet reserve to himself the right of disposal of the goods until the fulfilment of certain conditions and thereby prevent the passing of property in the goods from him to the buyer.",ANALYSIS
The facts found in this case are that the assessee company shipped the goods under bill of lading issued in its own name.,ANALYSIS
Under the contract it was not obliged to part with the bill of lading which is the document of title to the goods until the bill of exchange drawn by it on the buyers' Bank where the irrevocable letter of credit was opened was honoured.,ANALYSIS
"It is urged that under the provision in the contract for weighment and assay, which was ultimately to fix the price unless the buyer rightly rejected the goods as not being in terms of the contract, the passing of property in the goods could not take place until the buyer accepted the goods and the price was fully ascertained after weighment and assay.",ANALYSIS
"It is submitted that being the position, the property in the goods passed and the sales were concluded outside British India, for the weighment, sampling, assay and the final fixation of the price could only take place under all these contracts outside British India.",ANALYSIS
It is not necessary for us to express any opinion on this extreme contention.,ANALYSIS
"Suffice it to say, for the purposes of this case, that in any event upon the terms of the contracts in question and the course of dealings between the parties the property in the goods could not have passed to the buyer earlier than the date when the bill of exchange was accepted by the buyers' Bank in London and thedocuments were delivered by the assessee company's agent, the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, to the buyers"" Bank.",ANALYSIS
"This admittedly, and as found by the Appellate, Tribunal, always took place in London.",ANALYSIS
"It must, therefore,. follow that at the earliest the ;property in the goods passed in London where the bill of lading was handed over to the buyers' Bank against the acceptance of the relative bill of exchange.",ANALYSIS
"In the premises, the Appellate Tribunal as well as the High Court were quite correct in holding that the sales took place outside British India and, ex hypothesis the profits derived from such sales arose outside British India.",ANALYSIS
"
As to the second question, the.. learned Solicitor-General contends that irrespective of the place where the sale may have. taken place the profits derived from such sales were received in Madras.",ARG_PETITIONER
"It is recalled that after shipment the assessee company, through its managing agent in Madras, prepared, provisional invoices and drew bills of exchange for 80 per cent. or 90 per cent., as the case may be, of the amount of such invoices and handed over the same to the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, and received the amount of the bill of exchange from them in Madras.",ARG_PETITIONER
He contends that the receipt of this payment by the assessee company was really the receipt of the price of the goods and amounted to receipt of profits in Madras.,ARG_PETITIONER
"He draws our attention to the terms of payment in the European contract and to the letter of intimation of the opening of the credit sent by the Eastern Bank Ltd. Madras, to the assessee company which have been quoted in part in the earlier part of this judgment.",ARG_PETITIONER
"He relies on the words ""through the Eastern Bank Ltd.,"" appearing in the contract and the words ""available by delivery to us"" appearing in the letter.",ARG_PETITIONER
We do not think that those words support the contention of the learned Solicitor-General.,ANALYSIS
"The words ""through the Eastern Bank Ltd.,"" appear to us to go with the preceding words ""to be advised to sellers"" which are put within brackets which seem to have been wrongly closed after the word sellers' instead of after the words the Eastern Bank Ltd. "".",ANALYSIS
"Ordinarily, the buyer opens a letter of credit with his Bank in favour of the seller",ANALYSIS
"andthe words ""through the Eastern Bank Ltd.,"" would be meaningless unless it was intended to mean' that the irrevocable credit which was in favour of the assessee company was to be operated upon by the latter through the Eastern Bank Ltd. If that were the true meaning, then that certainly does not make the Eastern Bank Ltd., the agent of the buyers.",ANALYSIS
"The words ""available by delivery to us""
occurring in the letter of the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, do not appear to us to indicate that this was any part of the terms of the letter of credit.",ANALYSIS
"This was an intimation in accordance with the advice received by the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, from the Eastern Bank Ltd.,, London, that the assessee company might avail itself of the letter of credit by delivery of the documents to the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras.",ANALYSIS
"This is made further clear by the latter part of the letter where the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, expressed their willingness at their option to negotiate the drafts drawn in terms of the arrangement provided that the documents were in order,",ANALYSIS
"The concluding sentence of that letter whereby the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, disown any responsibility in respect of the advice clearly militates against the suggestion of the learned Solicitor-General.",ANALYSIS
"It is, in these circumstances, impossible to accede to the argument that the payment of 80 per cent. or 90 per cent., as the case may be, of the amount of the provisional invoice by the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, was a payment on account of the price.",ANALYSIS
"Normally, price is paid by or on behalf of the buyer.",ANALYSIS
"In this case the fact found is that the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, and the Eastern Bank Ltd., London., were agents of the assessee company.",ANALYSIS
Neither 'of 'them had any relation with the buyers.,ANALYSIS
"Therefore, a payment by them cannot be regarded as a payment of the price.",ANALYSIS
"The true position is very clearly put by Lord Sumner in The Prinz Adalbert(1) : "" When a shipper takes his draft, not as yet accepted, but accompanied by a bill of lading, indorsed in this way, and discounts it with a banker, he makes himself liable on the instrument as drawer, and he further makes the goods, which the bill of lading (1) L.R. [1917] A.C. 586, 589.represents, security for its payment.",PRE_RELIED
"If, in turn, the discounting banker surrenders the bill of lading to the acceptor against his acceptance, the inference is that he is satisfied to part with his security in consideration of getting this further party's liability on the bill, and that in so doing he acts with the permission and by the mandate of the shipper and drawer.",PRE_RELIED
"
This payment by the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, therefore, is nothing but an advance made by them to their own customer on the security of the goods covered by the bill of lading reinforced by the 'benefit of the liability taken up by the assessee company as drawer of the bill which in its turn is backed by the confirmed and irrevocable credit of the buyers' London Bank.",ANALYSIS
"If this payment was on account of the price, why should the assessee company, as the seller, undertake any liability to the Eastern Bank Ltd., as the drawer of the bill of exchange ?",ANALYSIS
"The truth of the matter is that the price was paid on behalf of the buyers by their respective London Banks in London to the Eastern Bank Ltd., London which was the agent of the assessee company.",ANALYSIS
"The first receipt of the price, therefore, as pointed out by the High Court, was by the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, on behalf of the sellers.",ANALYSIS
"There is no dispute that the balance of the price ascertained after weighment and assay and deducting the amount paid on the bill of exchange was similarly received in London by the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, on behalf of the assessee company.",ANALYSIS
"The subsequent adjustment made in the books of the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, did not operate as a receipt of profits in British India.",ANALYSIS
In our opinion the High Court correctly answered the second question also in favour of the assessee company.,RATIO
"
 For reasons stated above, this appeal must stand dismissed with costs and we order accordingly.",RPC

 The point arising for our decision is the applicability of section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code to the present case where the death alleged to be a dowry death occurred prior to insertion of section 304-B in the Indian Penal Code.",ISSUE
"This is the only ground on which the. appellant claims trial of the case in the Court of Session. .
.",ANALYSIS
The reason.given by the High Court to support its view is that the offence was committed prior to the date of insertion of section 304-B in the Indian Penal Code on account of which the section can have no application to the present case.,ANALYSIS
None of the courts below. has examined the applicability .of any other pre-existing more stringent provision even if section 304-B does not apply.,ANALYSIS
"As such affirmation of the view that section 304-B does not apply, will not preclude the appellant from contending that any other more stringent provision is attracted on the accusa- tion made.",ANALYSIS
"If that point is raised, the courts below will have to decide the same on merits on the basis of accusation made.",ANALYSIS
"It is in this background that the point raised by the appellant regarding applicability of section 304-B is decid- ed by us.. .
 Section 304-B and the cognate provisions are meant for eradication of the social evil of dowry which has been the bane of Indian society 'and continues unabated in spite of emanicipation of women and the women's liberation movement.
",ANALYSIS
This all prevading malady in our society has only a few lucky exception in spite of equal treatment and opportunity to boys and girls for education and career.,ANALYSIS
Society contin- ues to perpetuate the difference between them for the pur- pose of marriage and it is this distinction which makes the dowry system thrive.,ANALYSIS
"Even though for eradication of this social evil, effective steps can be taken by the society itself and the social sanctions of the community can be more deterrent, yet legal sanctions in the form of its .prohibi- tion and punishment are some steps in that direction.",ANALYSIS
"The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 was enacted for this purpsoe.",ANALYSIS
"
The Report of the Joint Committee of Parliament quoted the observations of Jawaharlal Nehru to indicate the role of legislation in dealing with the social evil as under: "" Legislation .cannot by itself normally solve deep-rooted social problems, One has to ap- proach them in other ways too, but legislation is necessary and essential, so that it may give that push and have that educative factor as well as the legal sanctions behind it which help public opinion to be given a certain shape.""         The enactment of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 in its original form was found inadequate.",ANALYSIS
Experience shows that the demand of dowry and the mode of its recovery takes different forms to achieve the same result and various indirect and sophisticated methods are being used to 'avoid leaving any evidence of the offence.,ANALYSIS
"Similarly, the conse- quences of non-fulfilment of the demand of dowry meted out to the unfortunate bride takes different forms to avoid any apparent causal connection between the demand of dowry and its prejudicial effect on the bride.",ANALYSIS
This experience has led to several other legislative measures in the continuing battle to combat this evil.,ANALYSIS
"
       The Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act, 1983 (No. 45 of 1983) was an act further to amend the Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.",ANALYSIS
"Section 498-A was inserted in the Indian Penal Code and corresponding amendments were made in the Code of Criminal Procedure which included section 198A .therein and also inserted section 113A in the Indian Evidence Act,.

"Thereafter, the Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 1986 (No. 43 of 1986) was enacted further to amend the Dowry Prohibition .Act, 1961 and to make certain .necessary changes in the Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.",ANALYSIS
"
       Two of the salient features of the Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 1986 (No. 43 of 1986) stated in the State- ment of Objects and Reasons of the Bill are as under: ""(e) Offences under the Act are proposed to be made non-bailable.",STA
"
 ""(g) A new offence of ""dowry death""

"Accordingly by section 7 of the Amendment Act, section 8 of the Dowry' Prohibition' Act, 1961 was amended to make every Offence under this Act non-bailable while continuing it to be non-compoundable.",ANALYSIS
"By sections 10, 11 and 12, amendments were made in the Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Proce- dure, 1973 and the Indian' Evidence Act, 1872, as part of the same scheme as follows: ""10.",STA
"In the Indian Penal Code, after, section 304-A, the following section shall be inserted, namely: '304-B. Dowry death.",STA
"(1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise then under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that .soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harass- ment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, Or in connection with, any demand for dowry such death shall be called ""dowry death"", and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.",STA
"
 Explanation-For the purposes of this sub-section, ,'dowry"". shall have the same meaning as in section 2 of the Dowry Prohibi- tion Act, 196 1 (28 of 1961).",STA
"
 (2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for ""11.",STA
"In the Code of Criminal Proce- dure, 1973, in the First Schedule after the entries relating to section 304-A, the follow- ing entries shall be inserted, namely: Section Offence Punishment COgnizable Bailable or By what or non-  non-bail-  Court",STA

"
 ' ""12.",STA
"In the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, after section 113-A, the following section shall be insert- ed, namely:- ""11.3-B. Presumption as to dowry death.-When the question is whether a person has committed the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her 'death.",STA
"such woman has been subjected by such .person to cruelty Or harassment for, or in connecting with, any demand for dowry, the Court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death.",STA
"
 Explanation.-For the purpose of this section', ""dowry death"" shall have the same meaning as in section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).""
 ",STA
"It is clear from the above historical background that the offence of dowry death punishable under section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code is a new offence inserted in the Indian Penal Code with effect from 19.11.1986 when Act No.
 43 of 1986 came into force.",ANALYSIS
The offence under section 304-B is punishable with a minimum sentence of seven years which may extend to life imprisonment and is triable by Court of Session.,ANALYSIS
The corresponding amendments made in the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act relate to the trial and proof of the offence.,ANALYSIS
"Section 498;A inserted in the Indian Penal Code by the Criminal Law (Second Amendment)Act, 1983 (Act No. 46 of 1983) is an offence triable by a Magistrate of the First Class and is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years in addition to fine.",ANALYSIS
It is for the offence punishable under section 498-A which was in the statute book on the date of death of Chhaya that the respondents are being tried in the Court of Magistrate of the First Class.,ANALYSIS
"The offence punisha- ble under section 304-B, known as. dowry death, was a new offence created with effect .from 19.11.1986 by insertion of the provision in the Indian Penal Code providing for a more stringent offence' than section 498-A.",ANALYSIS
"Section 304-B is a substantive provision creating a new offence and not merely a provision effecting a, change in procedure for trial of a pre-existing substantive offence.",ANALYSIS
Acceptance of the appel- lant's contention would amount to holding that the respond- ents can be tried and punished for the offence of dowry death provided in section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code with the minimum sentence of seven years' imprisonment for an act done by them prior to creation of the new offence of dowry death.,ANALYSIS
"In our opinion, this would clearly deny to them the protection afforded by clause (1) of Article 20 of the Constitution which reads as under: ""20.. Protection in respect of con- viction for offences.",STA
"--(1) No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of the law in force at the time of the commis- sion of the act charged as an offence, 'nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. ' '",STA
""" In our opinion ,. the protection given by Article 20(1) is a complete answer to the appellant's contention.",STA
"
 The contention 'of learned counsel 'for the appellant that section 304-B inserted in the Indian Penal Code does not create a new offence and' contains merely a rule of evidence is untenable.",ANALYSIS
The rule of evidence to prove the offence of dowry death is contained in section 113-B of the Indian Evidence Act providing for presumption as to dowry death which was a simultaneous' amendment made in the Indian Evidence Act for proving the offence of dowry death.,ANALYSIS
The fact that the Indian Evidence Act was so amended simultane- ously with the insertion of section 304-B in the Indian Penal' Code by the same Amendment Act is' another pointer in this direction.,ANALYSIS
"This contention is, therefore, rejected.",ANALYSIS
In follows that the view taken by the High Court that the respondents cannot be tried and punished for the offence provided in section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code which is a new offence created subsequent 'to the commission of the offence attributed to the respondents does not suffer from any infirmity.,RATIO
"However, as earlier indicated, in case the accusation against the respondents discloses commission of any other more stringent pre-existing offence by the re- spondents than section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code, the appellant would be entitled to raise that question and the Court will then consider and decide it on that basis.",ANALYSIS

The question to be considered at first stage is whether the accused has done an act by doing which he has caused the death of another person.,PRE_RELIED
Proof of such casual connection between the act of the accused and the death leads to the second stage for consideration whether that act of the accused amounts to 'culpable homicide' as defined in Section 299.,PRE_RELIED

If the answer of this question is prima facie found in the affirmative the stage is reached for considering the operation of Section 300 IP Code.",PRE_RELIED

 1. The District Court Martial imposed a punishment of dismissal of the Respondent from service and reduction of the ranks apart from sentencing him to rigorous imprisonment for three months.",FAC
"The Armed Forces Tribunal, Regional Bench, Lucknow (for short ""the Tribunal"") set aside the order of the District Court Martial aggrieved by which the Union of India has filed this Appeal.",RLC
The Respondent was enrolled in the Indian Air Force in the trade of Equipment Assistant on 18.01.1988.,FAC
"He was posted to 402 Air Force Station, Kanpur in August, 1997.",FAC
The Respondent was assigned duty in Diesel and Petrol Store on 02.02.2000.,FAC
"
Information was received from a civilian on 03.05.2000 that 7 barrels of diesel were unloaded in civil area at Pappu Ka Plot at about 1400 hrs. on 02.05.2000.",FAC
"The informant informed 4 Provost & Security (Unit), Air Force, Kanpur, that he saw two airmen in uniform, out of which one was of dark complexion.",FAC
The informant further stated that a similar incident of unloading of barrels was observed by him on 20.04.2000 also as well.,FAC
"
 2. A detailed report was sent by 4 Provost & Security (Unit), Air Force, Kanpur by a letter dated 10.05.2000 in which it was indicated that the Respondent-herein and Corporal G.S. Mani, Equipment Assistant were involved in taking out POL (Petrol, Oil & Lubricants) belonging to Air Force Station, Kanpur.",FAC
"Air-Officer-Commanding, 402 Air Force Station, Kanpur directed a Court of Inquiry to be convened.",FAC
"By its report dated 31.05.2000, the Court of Inquiry found that DHPP quantity of 5800 Ltrs. and petrol of 5000 Ltrs. was misappropriated by the Respondent and the then Corporal G.S. Mani, Equipment Assistant.",FAC
"According to the report, manipulation was done by raising gate passes for a quantity more than which was authorised by issuance of vouchers and obtaining the signature of Senior Logistic Officer on such gate passes.",FAC
"The said gate passes were used to take out kerosene, diesel and petrol.",FAC
"A second set of vouchers were prepared for the purpose of issuing gate passes when items were taken out of guard room, which were later destroyed after safe passage from the guard room.",FAC
The misappropriated items were disposed in the civil area.,FAC
"On the basis of the said finding, the Court of Inquiry recommended following actions : (a) Initiate strict disciplinary action against Corporal C.B. Yadav (Respondent) and others involved in the said action; (b) To make good the loss incurred due to such action and to recover the cost of quantity DHPP 400 Ltrs. and quantity 200 Ltrs. of petrol (Rs.68,520/-).
 3.",FAC
An Additional Court of Inquiry was ordered to further investigate into certain other aspects not covered by the Court of Inquiry.,FAC
"By the Report dated 12.07.2007, the Additional Court of Inquiry found that the Respondent had prepared the gate passes in advance on some occasions.",FAC
"The record of the Court of Inquiry and Additional Court of Inquiry proceedings were forwarded to the Head Quarters, Maintenance Command on 26.07.2000.",FAC
"The Court of Inquiry proceedings were approved by the AOC-in-C, Maintenance Command, pursuant to which disciplinary action was initiated against the Respondent and others.",FAC
"
A charge sheet was framed containing 14 charges and a hearing of charge under Rule 24 of the Air Force Rules, 1969 (for short ""the Rules"") was conducted before the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief.",FAC
The AOC-in-C ordered evidence to be recorded in writing.,FAC
"After considering the summary of evidence, the AOC-in-C found that there was insufficient evidence to sustain Charges 1 to 5 and therefore, those charges were dropped.",FAC
A charge sheet containing fresh charges was issued.,FAC
"
 4. On 27.08.2001, AOC-in-C Head Quarters, Maintenance Command convened a District Court Martial for trial of the Respondent.",FAC
The District Court Martial found the Respondent guilty and imposed a punishment of dismissal from service and reduction of the rank apart from sentencing the Respondent to rigorous imprisonment for three months.,FAC
The order dated 25.10.2001 was set aside by the Tribunal.,FAC
The Respondent was directed to have been in continuous service for the purpose of pension and other service benefits.,FAC
"However, arrears of salary was confined to 50 per cent.",FAC
"
 5. The Tribunal held that the allegation against the Respondent being theft and misappropriation of kerosene and diesel, the loss caused due to theft required to be reported to the civil police as per Para 804(b) of the Regulations.",FAC
"By referring to Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short ""the Cr.
PC), the Tribunal held that it is mandatory that a First Information Report (FIR) had to be registered in a cognizable case.",FAC
The Tribunal observed that the Respondent was not given an opportunity in terms of Rule 156 of the Rules during the Court of Inquiry proceedings.,FAC
"In view of the violation of sub-rule (2), (6) and (7) of Rule 156 of the Air Force Rules, the Tribunal was of the view that the proceedings of the Court of Inquiry were vitiated.",FAC
"The contention on behalf of the Respondent that there was violation of Rule 24 of the Rules and that the summary of evidence was also not recorded in accordance with the prescribed procedure, was not accepted by the Tribunal.",FAC
"Group Captain A.K.
",FAC
"Gurtu, Senior Personnel Staff Officer (SPSO), Head Quarters for Air Officer, Commanding-in-Chief signed the order by which the District Court Martial was convened which, according to the Tribunal was in violation of Section 111 of the Act and Rule 43(4) of the Rules.",FAC
The Tribunal observed that only the AOC-in-C is competent to convene the District Court Martial.,FAC
The Tribunal re-appreciated the evidence and came to the conclusion that the charges against the Respondent were not proved beyond reasonable doubt.,FAC
"
First Information Report (FIR) 6.",FAC
"Mr. Vinay Kumar Garg, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent submitted that Para 804 (b) of the Regulations imposes an obligation that a loss caused due to theft should be reported to the civil police.",ARG_RESPONDENT
He supported the finding of the Tribunal that there is requirement of compulsory registration of FIR in view of the provisions of Section 154 Cr. PC.,ARG_RESPONDENT
"Mr.
R. Balasubramanian, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Union of India submitted that Para 804(b) of the Regulations is not mandatory.",ARG_PETITIONER
It is open to the authorities to report a theft to the civil police if the situation warrants.,ARG_PETITIONER
"He submitted that the Air Force Act, 1950 and Air Force Regulations, 1964 govern the conduct and discipline of the Air Force.",ARG_PETITIONER
"The Air Force Act, 1950 is a special law in which detailed procedure for conducting of trial by a Court Martial has been prescribed and no requirement for registration of an FIR is mandatory under the Rules therein.",ARG_PETITIONER
The conduct of trial including investigation is covered under Air Force Act and the Rules.,ARG_PETITIONER
He referred to Section 5 of the Cr. PC to submit that the Cr. PC is not applicable to the personnel governed under the Air Force Act.,ARG_PETITIONER
"He relied upon the judgment of this Court in Ajmer Singh & Ors.
v. Union of India & Ors.1 in support of his argument.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
 7. In Ajmer Singh (supra), it was held as follows : ""7. Section 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure lays down that nothing contained in the said Code shall, in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary, affect any special or local law for the time being in force, or any special jurisdiction or power conferred, or any special form of procedure prescribed, by any other law for the time being in force.",PRE_RELIED
"The relevant Chapters of the Army Act, the Navy Act and the Air Force Act embody a completely self-contained comprehensive Code specifying the various offences under those Acts and 1 (1987) 3 SCC 340 prescribing the procedure for detention and custody of offenders, investigation and trial of the offenders by court martial, the punishments to be awarded for the various offences, confirmation and revision of the sentences imposed by court martial, the execution of such sentences and the grant of pardons, remissions and suspensions in respect of such sentences.",PRE_RELIED
"These enactments, therefore, constitute a special law in force conferring special jurisdiction and powers on court martial and prescribing a special form of procedure for the trial of the offences under those Acts.",PRE_RELIED
The effect of Section 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is to render the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure inapplicable in respect of all matters covered by such special law.,PRE_RELIED
"""
 8. It is clear from the above that the Air Force Act is a special law conferring jurisdiction and powers on the Court Martial and prescribing the procedure for trial of offences.",PRE_RELIED
It is also clear that the Code of Criminal Procedure is not applicable in respect of matters covered by the Air Force Act.,ANALYSIS
"Hence, the finding recorded by the Tribunal that it is mandatory for the authorities to report the offences to civil police for registration of an FIR is unsustainable.",FAC
The Tribunal further relied upon Para 804(b) of the Regulations to hold that it is incumbent on the part of the authorities to report an offence to the civil police for registration of an FIR.,FAC
"Para 804(b) is as follows: ""804. Loss of Air Force Equipment and Foodstuffs.
       (a) .. ..
       (b) A loss which is supposed to be due to theft will be reported at once to the civil police, when the circumstances warrant the course of action.",FAC
"In any court of inquiry which may subsequently be held, evidence will be taken to show the date on which the loss was so reported.""",FAC
"
 9. There can be no doubt from a plain reading of the Regulations that the reporting of an offence of theft to the civil police is optional.",FAC
"Only when the circumstances warrant such reporting to the civil police, the competent officer can do so.",FAC
"For the aforementioned reasons, para 804 (b) of the Regulations of the Air Force Act cannot be said to be mandatory.",FAC
"
 Court of Inquiry: 10.",FAC
"The contention of the Respondent which was accepted by the Tribunal relates to the violation of sub- Rule (2), (6) and (7) of Rule 156.",FAC
"It is necessary to reproduce sub-Rule (2), (6) and (7) of Rule 156 which are as under : ""156. Courts of inquiry other than those held under section 107.-- (1) .. ..
       (2) Save in the case of a prisoner of war who is still absent, whenever any inquiry affects the character or service reputation of a person subject to the Act, full opportunity must be afforded to such person of being present throughout the inquiry and of making any statements and of giving any evidence he may wish to make or give, and of cross-examining and witness whose evidence, in his opinion, affects his character or service reputation, and producing any witnesses in defence of his character or service reputation.
       (3) .. ..
 (4) .. ..
       (5) .. ..
       (6) The proceedings of a court of inquiry, or any confession or statement or answer to a question made or given at a court of inquiry, shall not be admissible in evidence against a person subject to Air Force Law, nor shall any evidence respecting the proceedings of the court be given against any such person except upon the trial of such person for wilfully giving false evidence before that court.",FAC
"
 (7) Any person subject to the Act whose character or service reputation is in the opinion of the Chief of the Air Staff, affected by anything in the evidence before or in the report of a court of inquiry shall be entitled to a copy of the proceedings of such court unless the Chief of the Air Staff sees reason to order otherwise.""
 11.",FAC
The Tribunal was of the view that the Respondent was not given sufficient opportunity to defend himself during the course of the proceedings before the Court of Inquiry.,FAC
"12. According to the Respondent, he was not permitted to be present during the recording of statement of witnesses.",FAC
He was also deprived of an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses.,FAC
The contention on behalf of the Union of India is that the Respondent was given an opportunity to make a statement and to cross- examine witnesses.,FAC
He was also given a chance to produce documentary evidence.,FAC
The Respondent made a statement on 19.07.2000 to the effect that he did not wish to cross-examine witnesses and to produce any documentary evidence in his defence.,FAC
13. The statement made by the Respondent was produced before us which indicates that he did not utilize the opportunity given to him.,FAC
"Therefore, it cannot be held that there is violation of Rule 156 of the Rules and the Tribunal committed an error in holding that the proceedings of Court of Inquiry are vitiated.",FAC
"
Convening Order: 14.",FAC
"The contention of the Respondent is that Group Captain A.K. Gurtu, Senior Personnel Staff Officer (SPSO), Head Quarters MC IAF signed the order by which the District Court Martial was convened.",FAC
It is urged that AOC-in-C is the competent authority to convene the Court Martial.,FAC
The Union of India justified the order by which the District Court Martial was convened in accordance with the Air Force Rules.,FAC
"
 15. Section 111 of the Air Force Act provides that District Court Martial may be convened by an officer having power to convene a General Court Martial, or by an officer empowered by warrant of any such officer.",FAC
"
Rule 43 deals with convening of General and District Court Martials.",FAC
"Rule 43(4) which is relevant for our purpose reads as under : ""43. Convening of general and district court- martial.",FAC
"-- (4) After the convening officer has appointed or detailed the officer to form a Court-Martial under sub-rule (3), convening order of the Court-Martial and endorsement on the charge- sheet for trial of the accused by court-martial may either be signed by convening officer or by a staff officer on his behalf.",FAC
"The charge sheet on which the accused to be tried, the summary of evidence and the convening order for assembly of Court-Martial",FAC
"shall then be sent to the senior officer of Court-Martial and the Judge Advocate, if appointed.""",FAC
"
 16. In Union of India & Ors. v. Ex. Flt. Lt. G.S.
 Bajwa2, this Court examined the issue pertaining to the authority competent to convene the Court Martial and held as follows: ""44.",PRE_RELIED
"A ground was taken before the High Court (Ground f) that the convening of the General Court Martial was signed by an officer, in whose name no delegation or such authority had ever been made.",PRE_RELIED
"In reply thereto the appellant had submitted that the convening order was signed by the said officer on behalf of the Air Officer In-charge Personnel, who had after due application of mind, issued the order for convening the above Court Martial.",PRE_RELIED
It was not disputed before us that the Air Officer In- charge Personnel (AOP) was empowered to convene a Court Martial.,PRE_RELIED
"The only question which, therefore, requires consideration is 2 (2003) 9 SCC 630 whether the order convening the General Court Martial was passed by the AOP and it was only formally communicated under signatures of the Air Commodore concerned or whether the Air Commodore named therein, who was not empowered, himself passed the convening order.",PRE_RELIED
"With a view to avoid any controversy on this factual position, we directed the appellant to produce before us the original file.",PRE_RELIED
"We have perused the file and we find that the order for convening the General Court Martial was approved by Air Marshal D.A. LaFontaine, AOP.",PRE_RELIED
"
       There is, therefore, no force in the submission that the convening order was unauthorized and, therefore, illegal.""
 17.",PRE_RELIED
"The order dated 18.08.2001 by which the District Court Martial was convened is issued in the name of Air Marshall S.S. Gupta, PVSM, AVSM, VSM, ADC, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Maintenance Command.",ANALYSIS
"There is no doubt that the order was signed by Group Captain A.K. Gurtu, SPSO, Head Quarters MC IAF who is the Personnel Staff Officer for Air Officer Commanding-in- Chief, Maintenance Command, IAF.",ANALYSIS
Rule 43(4) provides that a convening order may be signed by the Commanding Officer or by the Senior Staff Officer on his behalf.,ANALYSIS
"The fact that Group Captain A.K. Gurtu was the Senior Personnel Staff officer for the AOC-in-C Maintenance Command, IAF is not in dispute.",ANALYSIS
"A perusal of the Record reveals that the convening order had the approval of the competent authority and as such, it cannot be termed as unauthorized.",ANALYSIS
Another submission that was made by the learned Senior Counsel for the Respondent is that according to the Organizational Chart of Head Quarters MC IAF it is only Senior Air & Administrative Staff Officer (SAASO) who can be the Staff Officer of the AOC-in-C.,ANALYSIS
The said submission was countered by the learned Senior Counsel for the Union of India.,ANALYSIS
"It was contended that that Group Captain A.K.
Gurtu was Senior Personnel Staff Officer (SPSO) and lesser than that of Senior Air & Administrative Staff Officer (SAASO) in the hierarchy.",ANALYSIS
There is no requirement that only SAASO can be the Staff Officer to AoC-in-C.,ANALYSIS
Even Officers lower than SAASO can be appointed as Staff Officers.,ANALYSIS
"According to Mr. R.
 Balasubramanian, learned Senior Counsel, it is evident from the order itself that Group Captain A.K. Gurtu who is Senior Personnel Staff Officer (SPSO) was the Staff Officer and competent to sign the convening order.",ANALYSIS
"
 18. The convening order which was signed by the Staff Officer of the AOC-in-C is in accord with Rule 43(4) of the Rule and no fault can be found with the order.",ANALYSIS
The Tribunal committed an error in holding that the convening order was by an officer who was not competent.,ANALYSIS
Charges 5 & 6 19.,ANALYSIS
"The District Court Martial found the Respondent guilty of Charges 1, 2, 5 and 6.",ANALYSIS
He was exonerated of Charges 3   and 4.,ANALYSIS
The confirmation authority held that there was no sufficient evidence in relation to Charges 1 and 2 and they were dropped.,ANALYSIS
What remains to be seen is whether Charges 5 & 6 are established.,ANALYSIS
"
 Charges 5 & 6 are as follows: ""
     Fifth Charge Committing Criminal Breach of Trust Section 52(c)   in Respect of property belonging to Air Force Act,  the Govt.

 20",ANALYSIS
. The Tribunal on a reconsideration of the evidence on record concluded that Charges 5 and 6 were not established beyond reasonable doubt.,ANALYSIS
PW1 Corporal M.K. Sharma failed to identify the signatures appended on the vouchers.,ANALYSIS
PW2 Sergeant L. Singh who was the Record Keeper in Security Section deposed that he was not aware as to who was responsible for the issuance of kerosene oil.,ANALYSIS
"W.O. S.K. Singh who was examined as PW3, does not remember the dates and data with regard to deficiencies of POL.",ANALYSIS
"He stated that no deficiency was found in POL during the weekly snap checks from February-May, 2000.",ANALYSIS
"He further stated that the Respondent was not related to issuance of kerosene oil during the months of February-May, 2000.",ANALYSIS
Wing Commander J.K. Chakraborty who appeared as PW4 admitted that there was no deficiency of diesel at the time of handing and taking over of duty by the Respondent.,ANALYSIS
PW5 Flight Lieutenant Arvind Kumar had no personal knowledge of the evidence as he was on leave.,ANALYSIS
"However, he stated that there was no surplus or deficiency of POL.",ANALYSIS
PW6 Corporal G.S. Mani admitted to unloading seven empty barrels at Pardevanpurwa on 20.04.2000 at the request of the Respondent.,ANALYSIS
"He further stated that an amount of Rs.1,500/- was forcibly given by the Respondent.",ANALYSIS
He also stated that he carried 20 barrels for collecting 2400 liters of kerosene oil and again collected seven barrels on 02.05.2000.,ANALYSIS
"During cross-examination, he was confronted with his previous statement wherein he stated that he was coerced to make a statement against the Respondent.",ANALYSIS
"In view of the contradictions made by PW6 who is the co-accused, the Tribunal held that he is not a reliable witness.",ANALYSIS
PW7 Corporal S. Singh categorically stated that the loading of barrels containing POL was at the behest of Corporal G.S. Mani.,ANALYSIS
PW8 Hasan R. Lascar who was working in the Medical Ward stated that he loaded empty barrels on the instructions of Corporal G.S. Mani.,ANALYSIS
PW9 Rajendra Prasad Lascar also stated that loading and off loading of diesel at Pardevanpurwa was in the presence of Corporal G.S. Mani.,ANALYSIS
21. We have examined the evidence to satisfy ourselves as to whether there is any iota of evidence against the Respondent.,RATIO
It appears from the evidence that Corporal G.S. Mani was actively involved in the transportation of diesel barrels and loading and off loading in the civil area.,RATIO
Curiously no action was taken against Corporal G.S. Mani.,RATIO
There is no evidence on record to connect the Respondent to the offence of illegal transportation of POL.,RATIO
"Though we are not in agreement with the Tribunal on the other issues, in view of lack of any evidence against the Respondent, we are inclined to uphold the judgment of the Tribunal.",RATIO

CM No. 13614/2010 (for condonation of delay in filing the appeal) & CM No. 13616/2012 (for condonation of delay in re-filing the appeal) in ITA No. 453/2012 CM No. 14085/2012 (for condonation of delay in filing the appeal) in ITA No. 464/2012 1.,FAC
"These are three applications seeking condonation of the delay in filing and re-filing two appeals filed by the Revenue under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 („Act‟) challenging the common impugned order dated 5th April 2007 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal („ITAT‟) in I.T(SS).A.No.352/Del/1997 and I.T(SS).A.No.104/Del/1997 relating to the block period 1st April 1986 to 6th November 1996.",FAC
"
 2. The background facts are that Elegant Travels Private Limited („ETPL‟) was incorporated on 17th January 1987.",FAC
"It had three Directors of which one was Mr. Arvinder Singh, the Respondent in ITA No. 453/2012.",FAC
"It is stated that ETPL is engaged in the business of travel agents, tour operators and ticketing etc. and had the agency of Indian Airlines and Vayudoot.",FAC
The ticketing business is stated to have been closed in 1990 consequent upon a change in the policy.,FAC
"
 3. Search and seizure operations were carried out under Section 132 of the Act on Mr. Buta Singh, the father of Mr. Arvinder Singh, and Group.",FAC
"Notice was issued under Section 158BD of the Act requiring ETPL as well as Mr.
Arvinder Singh to file their respective returns of income.",FAC
Another similar notice was issued under Section 142(1) of the Act.,FAC
"After the Assessees filed their written submissions, fresh notices were issued to them under Section 143(2) of the Act.",FAC
"4. As far as Mr. Arvinder Singh was concerned, the Assessing Officer („AO‟) completed the assessment under Section 158BC read with Section 113 of the Act on 28th November 1997 and computed the undisclosed income as Rs.1,33,08,737.",FAC
"Aggrieved by the above order, Mr. Arvinder Singh filed an appeal before the ITAT.",FAC
"By the impugned order dated 5th April 2007, the ITAT held that no valid opportunity was granted to the Assessee before making the impugned order of assessment and further that the requisite satisfaction was not recorded by the AO before initiating proceedings under Section 158BD of the Act.",FAC
"The ITAT, therefore, declined to examine the merits.",FAC
"5. As far as ETPL was concerned, by assessment order dated 30th September 1998 the AO completed the assessment and computed the total income of the Assessee as Rs.34,95,760.",FAC
ETPL also filed an appeal before the ITAT.,FAC
"
By the same impugned order dated 5th April 2007, the appeal filed by the ETPL was allowed by the ITAT by setting aside the impugned assessment order on the ground of failure to provide an opportunity to the Assessee and to record satisfaction before initiating proceedings under Section 158BD of the Act.",FAC
6. The present two appeals were filed on different dates.,FAC
"While ITA No.
453/2012 appears to have been filed in the first instance on 18 th December 2010, ITA No. 464/2012 appears to have been filed on 14th August 2012.",FAC
"
 7. Initially in the application CM No. 13614/2010 seeking condonation of delay in filing ITA NO. 453/2012 (CIT v. Arvinder Singh) it was claimed that there was only 22 days' delay in filing the appeal.",FAC
It was stated in the said application that initially no appeal was preferred against the impugned order dated 5th April 2007 of the ITAT as at that stage “it was considered more appropriate to reframe the assessment.” 8.,FAC
CM No. 13616/2012 came to be filed in ITA No. 453/2012 seeking to explain the extraordinary delay of 429 days in re-filing the appeal.,FAC
In this application it is claimed that a copy of the impugned order dated 5th April 2007 of the ITAT was received in the office of the Appellant only on 29th July 2010.,FAC
The appeal was required to be filed on or before 28 th November 2010 but was filed on 18th December 2010.,FAC
"Consequently, it was asserted that there was only a delay of 22 days.",FAC
"As far as the delay in re-filing was concerned, it was explained that on account of the resignation of the Standing Counsel of the Income Tax Department who had filed the matter in December 2010, the defects pointed out by the Registry could not be attended to.",FAC
"It was only when the appeal of ETPL against the subsequent order of the ITAT dated 16th December 2009 was filed, it was noticed that ITA No. 453/2012 was unattended and it was only thereafter that the objections were removed and the appeal was re-filed.",FAC
"9. The explanation offered for the delay in filing ITA No. 464/2012, in which ETPL was the Respondent, requires to now be noticed.",FAC
"The explanation offered in CM No. 14085/2012 (in ITA No. 464/2012) is that pursuant to the order dated 5th April 2007 of the ITAT setting aside the assessment order, the AO issued a fresh notice under Section 143(2) of the Act and thereafter framed a fresh assessment on 31st December 2008.",FAC
"
Against this assessment order, appeals were filed before the ITAT.",FAC
"By order dated 16th October 2009, the ITAT quashed the assessment on the ground that when in the first round the ITAT had set aside the assessment by its order dated 5th April 2007, no directions had been given to the AO to pass a fresh order.",FAC
The Revenue appealed against the said order dated 16th October 2009 of the ITAT to this Court by way of ITA No. 2018/2010.,FAC
"It is stated that when ITA No. 2018/2010 was listed before the Court some time in 2010, the Revenue sought leave to file an appeal against the ITAT's first order dated 5th April 2007.",FAC
"Thereafter, the Standing counsel for the Revenue immediately wrote to the Department informing it of the necessity to file an appeal against the impugned order dated 5 th April 2007 of the ITAT.",FAC
No dates are mentioned in relation to any of the aforementioned events.,FAC
It is simply stated that the said documents were then made available to the Standing counsel on 10th August 2012 and thereafter the present appeal was drafted.,FAC
The appeal was filed on 14th August 2012 with a delay of 626 days.,FAC
"
 10. In CM No. 14085/2012 it is also stated that the impugned order of the ITAT dated 5th April 2007 was received in the office of the Appellant only on 29th July 2010.",FAC
"
 11. The Court notices that the above assertion, both in CM No. 13616/2012 came to be filed in ITA No. 453/2012 and in CM No. 14085/2012 in ITA No. 464 of 2012 that the order of the ITAT dated 5th April 2007 was received only on 29th July 2010, i.e. after three years and seven months, does not appear to be correct or convincing.",FAC
The reason is this.,FAC
"
 12. The Court had by an order dated 31st July 2014 granted the Appellant time to file an additional affidavit explaining “sufficient cause and reasons for the delay in filing the appeal against the order dated 5th April 2007.”",ANALYSIS
In the same order the Court observed “it is the duty of the Appellant to bring on record true and correct facts and justify why and for what reason no appeal was initially preferred against the order dated 5th April 2007; whether the order was accepted by the Revenue at that stage; why the decision was accepted and fresh block assessment order was passed.”,ANALYSIS
Opportunity was also given to the Respondent to file reply to the said affidavit.,ANALYSIS
"
 13. Pursuant to the above order the Appellant filed an additional affidavit on 22nd September 2014.",FAC
"Interestingly, in this additional affidavit (which is actually a submission supported by an affidavit) it is stated inter alia that when ITA No. 2018/2010 (being the appeal of the Revenue against the ITAT's order dated 16th October 2009) was listed for hearing on 28th January 2011 an order was passed by the Court noting the contention of the counsel for the Revenue that there was no impediment for the AO to have passed a fresh assessment order.",ANALYSIS
"On that basis, notice was issued in the said appeal.",FAC
"It was stated in the additional affidavit in para 12 as under: """,ANALYSIS
"12.During the course of proceedings in the aforementioned case, it was pointed out by the Counsel for the Revenue to the Department on 28.01.2011,that the Department is under a mistaken belief that ITAT vide order dated 05.04.2007 has remanded the matter to the AO to reframe the assessment after allowing opportunity of being heard to the Assessee.",ANALYSIS
"
            This mistaken belief was particularly for the reason that it was the contention of the Assessee before the ITAT that Assessing officer while passing AO violated the principles of natural justice by not providing an opportunity of being heard to the Assessee.",ANALYSIS
The said mistaken belief is also reflected in the CSR recorded by the Department dated 08.02.2010.,ANALYSIS
"Copy of the CSR dated 08.02.2010 is attached herewith as ANNEXURE C.""
 14.",ANALYSIS
"It was further stated in para 13 that “on the basis of the aforementioned advise of the Counsel for the Revenue, the case file along with complete record was handed over to the counsel on 10.08.2012 and appeal before the Hon'ble High Court was filed On 14.08.2012.” 15.",ANALYSIS
"Nowhere in the additional affidavit is any explanation offered for the extraordinary delay between 28th January 2011, when counsel for the Revenue is supposed to have advised the Department that an appeal should be filed against the impugned order dated 5th April 2007, and 10th August 2012, when papers were actually entrusted to counsel for the Revenue for filing such an appeal.",ANALYSIS
"In other words, for a delay of one year and seven months there is no explanation whatsoever.",ANALYSIS
"
 16. Thereafter in para 14 it is stated that “in the present case the certified copy of the AO dated 5th April 2007 was received by Department/Revenue on 26th June 2007.”",ANALYSIS
"Clearly, therefore, the earlier submissions made to the effect that the impugned order dated 5th April 2007 was received only on 29th July 2010 was incorrect.",ANALYSIS
Even otherwise it seems extremely unlikely that it would take the Department over three years and three months to receive a copy of an order of the ITAT in the Department.,ANALYSIS
The very fact that a fresh notice was issued by the AO under Section 143(2) of the Act way back on 1st October 2008 obviously meant that a copy of the order dated 5th April 2007 of the ITAT was received prior to that date.,ANALYSIS
"Therefore, for the purposes of these appeals the Court will proceed on the basis of the statement made by the Revenue itself in para 14 of the additional affidavit that it had received a copy of the order dated 5th April 2007 on 26th July 2007 itself.",ANALYSIS
"
 17. Consequently, for computing the delay in filing the present appeals, the limitation should be reckoned from 26th June 2007, as rightly pointed out by the Respondent in its reply to the additional affidavit.",ANALYSIS
The Revenue has a limitation period of 120 days i.e. 4 months to file an appeal under Section 260A of the Act.,ANALYSIS
"Therefore, the last date for filing the appeals was 26th October 2007.",ANALYSIS
Keeping that view if the actual dates for filing of the two appeals are taken into consideration then the actual delay works out to far more than what is claimed by the Revenue.,ANALYSIS
"As far as ITA No. 453 of 2012 is concerned, the date of filing was 18th December 2010 and the delay works out to 3 years, 5 months and 22 days, i.e. 1271 days.",ANALYSIS
"As far as ITA No. 464 of 2012 is concerned, the actual date of filing was 14th August 2012 and the delay works out to 5 years, 1 month and 19 days, i.e. 1876 days.",ANALYSIS
"
 18. That the Revenue itself is confused about the exact days of delay is apparent from the additional affidavit filed by it in ITA No. 464/2012 where it has computed the delay in filing the said appeal as 565 days.",ANALYSIS
"
 19. The purpose of the Court passing the order dated 31 st July 2014 requiring a proper affidavit to be filed by the Revenue was to give it one more opportunity of giving a satisfactory explanation for the extraordinary delay in filing the appeals.",ANALYSIS
"Unfortunately, even by way of the additional affidavit dated 14th September 2014, the Revenue has been unable to offer any convincing explanation.",ANALYSIS
"
 20. It was urged by Mr. Rohit Madan, learned Senior Standing counsel for the Revenue, that it was only on account of confusion in the Department on whether the impugned order dated 5th April 2007 of the ITAT could be challenged that there was an extraordinary delay in filing the appeals.",ARG_PETITIONER
"As already noticed from the additional affidavit filed by the Revenue on 22 nd September 2014, the Department was informed by counsel way back on 28 th January 2011 that it ought to file appeal against the ITAT's order dated 5th April 2007.",ANALYSIS
"Therefore after 28th January 2011, the Department could not claim to be still under any confusion as to the course of action it was expected to take.",ANALYSIS
It is plain that it did not take any urgent action as far as filing ITA No. 464/2012 was concerned till 14th August 2012.,ANALYSIS
"
 21. As far as ITA No. 453/2012 is concerned although it was directed against the same impugned order dated 5th April 2007 of the ITAT, there appears to have been no confusion on the necessity for filing such an appeal.",ANALYSIS
"
The reason given in CM No. 13614/2012 for the delay is again totally unconvincing.",ANALYSIS
The appeal appears to have been prompted by the ITAT quashing the reassessment order by the order dated 16th October 2009.,ANALYSIS
"
Nevertheless, even if one takes the said order of the ITAT as the trigger, the appeal was filed only on 18th December 2010 i.e. more than an year and two months thereafter.",ANALYSIS
Therefore even that delay is not satisfactorily explained.,ANALYSIS
"
 22. In Postmaster General v. Living Media India Ltd. (2012) 3 SCC 563, the Supreme Court has deprecated the casual attitude of government departments in taking steps to file appeals within reasonable time in the following words: ""26. In spite of affording another opportunity to file better affidavit by placing adequate material, neither the Department nor the person in-charge has filed any explanation for not applying the certified copy within the prescribed period.",PRE_RELIED
"The other dates mentioned in the affidavit which we have already extracted, clearly show that there was delay at every stage and except mentioning the dates of receipt of the file and the decision taken, there is no explanation as to why such delay had occasioned.",ANALYSIS
"Though it was stated by the Department that the delay was due to unavoidable circumstances and genuine difficulties, the fact remains that from day one the Department or the person/persons concerned have not evinced diligence in prosecuting the matter to this Court by taking appropriate steps.",ANALYSIS
"
 27. It is not in dispute that the person(s) concerned were well aware or conversant with the issues involved including the prescribed period of limitation for taking up the matter by way of filing a special leave petition in this Court.",ANALYSIS
They cannot claim that they have a separate period of limitation when the Department was possessed with competent persons familiar with court proceedings.,ANALYSIS
"In the absence of plausible and acceptable explanation, we are posing a question why the delay is to be condoned mechanically merely because the Government or a wing of the Government is a party before us.",ANALYSIS
"
 28. Though we are conscious of the fact that in a matter of condonation of delay when there was no gross negligence or deliberate inaction or lack of bonafide, a liberal concession has to be adopted to advance substantial justice, we are of the view that in the facts and circumstances, the Department cannot take advantage of various earlier decisions.",ANALYSIS
The claim on account of impersonal machinery and inherited bureaucratic methodology of making several notes cannot be accepted in view of the modern technologies being used and available.,ANALYSIS
The law of limitation undoubtedly binds everybody including the Government.,ANALYSIS
"
 29. In our view, it is the right time to inform all the government bodies, their agencies and instrumentalities that unless they have reasonable and acceptable explanation for the delay and there was bonafide effort, there is no need to accept the usual explanation that the file was kept pending for several months/years due to considerable degree of procedural red-tape in the process.",ANALYSIS
The government departments are under a special obligation to ensure that they perform their duties with diligence and commitment.,ANALYSIS
"
            Condonation of delay is an exception and should not be used as an anticipated benefit for government departments.
            The law shelters everyone under the same light and should not be swirled for the benefit of a few.
 30.",RATIO
"Considering the fact that there was no proper explanation offered by the Department for the delay except mentioning of various dates, according to us, the Department has miserably failed to give any acceptable and cogent reasons sufficient to condone such a huge delay.
            ",RATIO
"Accordingly, the appeals are liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay.” 23.",PRE_RELIED
"In State of Uttar Pradesh v. Amar Nath Yadav (2014) 2 SCC 422 while reiterating the above decision, the Supreme Court declined to condone the delay of 481 days in the State filing a special leave petition against the judgment of the High Court of Allahabad.",PRE_RELIED
"24. Consequently, the Court is not satisfied with the reasons offered for the extraordinary delay of 1271 days in filing ITA No. 453 of 2012 and the delay of 1876 days in filing ITA No. 464 of 2012.",RATIO
"Accordingly CM Nos.
13614/2010 in ITA No. 453/2012 and CM No. 14085/2012 in ITA No.
464/2012 are dismissed.",RPC
"
 25. The reasons for the delay of 426 days in re-filing ITA No. 453 of 2012 are also wholly unconvincing.",RATIO
"CM No. 13616/2012 in ITA No. 453/2012 is also, therefore, dismissed.",RPC
"
 26. With the dismissal of the aforementioned applications, the appeals ITA Nos. 453 and 464 of 2012 are also dismissed.",RPC

The informant had arrested the accused as she has committed an offence U/S. 47(a) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act after explaining her the grounds of her arrest and intimating her family members.,FAC

 The only question which arises for consideration in these appeals is whether the orders of assessment in the above two cases which had admittedly been passed beyond four years from the last day of the assessment year but within the period of six years from that date had been validly passed.",ISSUE
"By virtue of section 9 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 the procedure prescribed for making an assessment under the Act is applicable to the assessments to be made under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.",ANALYSIS
Section 13 of the Act prescribes that every dealer who is liable to get himself registered under section 12 or section 12-A as the case may be under the Act shall submit such return or returns relating to his turnover in such manner within such period and to such authority as may be prescribed.,STA
"The material part of section 14 which is relevant for purposes of these cases reads thus: ""14. Assessment of tax: ( I) If the assessing authority is satisfied that any return submitted under section 13 is correct and complete, he shall assess the amount of tax payable by the dealer on the basis thereof, but if the return appears to him to be incorrect or incomplete he shall, after giving the dealer a reasonable opportunity of proving the correctness and completeness of the return submitted by him and making such inquiry as he deems necessary, assess to the best of his judgment, the amount of tax due from the dealer.

 (3) Where any dealer liable to tax under this Act- (i) fails to submit return before the date prescribed in that behalf, or (ii) produces the accounts, registered and other documents after inspection, or (iii) submits a return subsequent to the date of inspection, the assessing authority may, at any time within a period of six years from the expiry of the year to which assessment relates, after issuing a notice to the dealer and after such enquiry as he considers necessary, assess to the best of his judgment, the amount of tax due from the dealer on his turnover for that year, and may direct the dealer to pay in addition to the tax so assessed penalty as specified in subsection (8).""
         ",STA
It is necessary to analyse sub-section (1) and sub- section (3) of section 14 of the Act for purposes of determining the issue involved in these cases.,ANALYSIS
"Sub-section ( ]) of section 14 of the Act provides that if the assessing authority is satisfied that any return submitted under section 13 is correct and complete, he shall assess the amount of tax payable by the dealer on the basis thereof but if the return appears to the assessing authority to be incorrect or incomplete he shall after giving the dealer reasonable opportunity of proving the correctness and completeness of the return submitted and making such inquiry as he deems necessary, assess to the best of his judgment, the amount of tax due from the dealer.",STA
In both these cases the return contemplated is one which has been filed in accordance with section 13 of the Act within the time prescribed for that purpose.,ANALYSIS
Such an assessment under sub- section ( 1) of section 14 of the Act can be made within a period of four years from the expiry of the period to which the assessment relates.,ANALYSIS
"Sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act authorises the assessing authority to make an assessment to the best of his judgment in three cases: (i) where a dealer under the Act fails to submit return before the date prescribed in that behalf, (ii) where a dealer produces the accounts. registers and other documents after inspection and (iii) where a dealer submits a return subsequent to the date of inspection.",STA
In these three cases theassessing authority is empowered to make an assessment to the best of '4 his judgment at any time within a period of six years from the expiry of the year to which the assessment relates after issuing a notice to the dealer and after such inquiry which he considers necessary to make the assessment.,ANALYSIS
"
         The crucial question which arises for consideration in these cases is whether in a case where the assessee submits a true and complete return after the prescribed date the assessment should be completed within a period of four years prescribed by sub-section ( 1) of section 14 of the Act or within a period of six years permitted under sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act.",ANALYSIS
Sub-section (1) of section 14 of the Act relates to an assessment which may be made on the basis of a return submitted under section 13 of the Act.,ANALYSIS
Section 13 of the Act as stated above provides that every dealer shall submit such return or returns relating to his turnover in such manner within such period and to such authority as may be prescribed.,STA
"The return on the basis of which an assessment is to be made under section 14(1) of the Act is, therefore, a return filed within the prescribed period and in such a case the assessment has to be completed within a period of four years from the expiry of the year to which the assessment relates.",ANALYSIS
The return referred to in sub- section ( 1) of section 14 of the Act cannot be a return filed beyond the prescribed date is emphasised by clause (i) of sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act which refers to a case where a dealer liable to pay tax fails to submit return before the date prescribed in that behalf.,ANALYSIS
All cases where the return is submitted beyond the prescribed date fall under sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act.,ANALYSIS
"
 The scheme of the Act regarding the period within which assessments can be made is very simple.",ANALYSIS
Assessments in cases falling under sub-section (1) of section 14 of the Act have to be completed within four years from the expiry of the year to which the assessment relates and assessments in cases falling under sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act may be completed within six years from the expiry of the year to which the assessment relates.,ANALYSIS
The two types of cases which fall under sub-section (l) and sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act respectively are mutually exclusive.,ANALYSIS
When once it is established in case that a return has not been filed within the prescribed period such case falls outside section 14 ( l) of the Act and therefore the period of four years prescribed therein becomes automatically inapplicable.,ANALYSIS
It clearly falls under clause (i) of sub- section (3) of section 14 of the Act and assessment can be made in such a case within the expiry of the period of six years.,ANALYSIS
"While a dealer who files a return within the prescribedperiod acquires immunity against assessment on the expiry of four years from the last day of the assessment year, a dealer who fails to file a return within the prescribed period has to wait for six years to be over to acquire such immunity.",ANALYSIS
Thus the Act confers a distinct advantage on a dealer who is prompt in filing his return.,ANALYSIS
"
 We are not impressed by the argument that since the returns in the cases before us had been accepted even though they had been filed beyond the prescribed date the assessments made thereon cannot be considered as best judgment assessment and therefore sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act under which it is permissible to make best judgment assessments would be inapplicable.",ANALYSIS
The period within which assessments can be made under the Act does not depend upon the answer to the question whether the assessment in question is a best judgment assessment or it is an assessment made treating the return as correct and complete but it depends upon the other conditions mentioned in sub-section ( 1) and in sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act.,ANALYSIS
"We may here point out that even in a case falling under subsection (1) of section 14 of the Act it is possible for the assessing authority to make a best judgment assessment as can be seen from the latter part of the said sub-section which reads: ""but if the return appears to him to be incorrect or incomplete he shall after giving the dealer a reasonable opportunity of proving the correctness and completeness of the return submitted by him and making such inquiry as he deems necessary, assess to the best of his judgment, the amount of tax due from the dealer.""",STA
Yet such best judgment assessment has to be completed within a period of four years from the expiry of the year to which the assessment relates.,ANALYSIS
Hence it cannot be held that merely because the assessments in question are not best judgment assessments sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act is inapplicable for best judgment assessments can be made both under sub-section (1) and subsection (3) of section 14 of the Act.,ANALYSIS
"That the assessment is a best judgment assessment is not, therefore, decisive of the question involved in these appeals.",ANALYSIS
"
 The decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the State of Andhra Pradesh v. Pyarelal Malhotra 13 S.T.C. 946 and the decision of this Court in the State of Madras v.
 S.G. Jayaraj Nadar & Sons 28 S.T.C. 700 which dealt with the question as to when a best judgment assessment could be made are not relevant for purposes of deciding the question which has arisen before us.",PRE_NOT_RELIED
As we have already pointed out the question whether the assessment made is the best judgment assessment or not has no bearing at all on the period within which an assess- ment can be made under the Act.,ANALYSIS
Neither in the judgment of the High Court against which Civil Appeal No. 4448 of 1985 is filed nor in the judgment of the Tribunal out of which Civil Appeal No. 694 of 1986 arises adequate attention is given to the words 'before the date prescribed in that behalf in clause (i) of sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act.,ANALYSIS
"The High Court and the Tribunal laid emphasis only on the words ""fails to submit return"" in the said sub-clause and it is on this account they arrived at a wrong conclusion.",ANALYSIS
"
 On a true construction of sub-section (I) and sub- section (3) of section 14 of the Act we are of opinion that where a return is not filed by a dealer before the date prescribed in that behalf under the Act, the assessing authority has got jurisdiction to complete the assessment within a period of six years from the expiry of the year to which the assessment relates.",RATIO
"Admittedly, in these cases the returns were not filed within the prescribed date and the assessments have been made within six years from the expiry of the year to which the assessments relate.",RATIO

         Subhra Chakraborty (alias - Kalpana) who was a student of the Baptist College, Kohima where the opposite party, Shri Bodhisattwa Gautam was a lecturer, filed a complaint in the Court of the Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, Kohima, Nagaland, alleging, inter alia, as under :- ""3.",FAC
"That, your complainant begs to state that in April 1989 the accused person entered into Baptist College, Kohima as a Lecturer thereof and the complainant was a student of the said College at that relevant period.",FAC
"4. That, the accused person was in said Service in Kohima from April 1989 till he resigned the Service on 27th Jan, 1995 and was residing in a rented house in Kenezou Valley, Kohima owned by Dr. Zakiebatsu Angam.",FAC
"
         5.",FAC
"That, on 6th Feb. 1995 the accused person left for silchar and presently residing in his uncle's (Shri Amiya Kanta Chakraborty) house in Premtala, Silchar-4, Dist. Cachar, in the State of Assam and assumed his service as Lecturer in Cachar College (Commerce Dept.) Silchar - 4 (Assam).
         6.",FAC
"That, on the 10th June, 1989 for the 1st time the accused visited the complainant's residence in Kohima and thereafter often he used to visit complainant's residence, as a teacher he was respected by the complainant as well as all the members including her parents.",FAC
In course of such visits once in the month of Nov. 1989 the accused voluntarily told your complainant that he was already in her love.,FAC
Thus there developed a love affair between themselves since 1989.,FAC
"7. That, the complainant most humbly states further that with malafide intention to practise deception on the complainant, the accused gave false assurance of marriage to the innocent complainant and thereby the accused dishonestly procured sexual intercourse with the complainant.",FAC
"The accused often use to induce the complainant to have biological contact with him, but whenever he was approached by the complainant to complete the marriage ceremony, the accused very tactfully used to defer the marriage sometimes saying that he was waiting for his parents formal consent and sometimes saying to cooperate him till he got a Govt. Service.",FAC
"8. That, in course of continuation of the affairs between the complainant and the accused, the complainant got pregnant twice, once in the month of September, 1993 and secondly on in the month of April 1994 out of her co- habitation with the accused person.",FAC
"9. That, the complainant being worried about her said pregnancy created pressure upon the accused to marry her immediately and to save her from being ruined, but the accused on the plea of his parents permission went on deferring the marriage, as a result there was a quarrel in between the complainant and the accused, where after the accused lastly opined for secret marriage to avoid social gathering as he was waiting for his parents permission.",FAC
"The complainant being pregnant was placed in a very awkward position, as such, agreed to said secret marriage, accordingly the accused on the 20th September, 1993, married the complainant in front of the God he Worships in his residence in Kenozou Valley, Kohima by putting Vermilion (sindur) on the complainant's forehead and accepted the complainant as his lawful wife and thus the complainant was consorted and consoled.",FAC
"But the complainant faced further corporal punishment, as the accused kept on insisting the complainant to be refrained from giving birth to the baby and was pressurizing her to undergo operation/abortion despite her refusal for the same.",FAC
The accused with fraudulent intention to deceive the complainant proposed the said abortion on the plea that birth of the baby would be a barrier to convince his parents to accept the complainant as their daughter-in-law and such event would lead the complainant to a path of unhappiness.,FAC
"The complainant being an innocent lady failed to understand the accused's wicked and mischievous plan whereby the accused succeeded and dishonestly motivated the complainant to undergo operation in the Putonou Clinic, Kohima and aborted in October' 93.",FAC
"
 10. That, the said Ceremony of giving Sindur (Vermilion) on the complainant's forehead by the accused in front of the God made the complainant to believe that she was lawfully married wife of the accused and with such believe she in good faith completely submitted herself to the accused as an ideal wife and never disbelieved the accused.",FAC
The complainant even did not have any doubt as to why the accused insisted her to keep their marriage secret.,FAC
"The complainant was forced to undergo abortion even second time in the month of April' 94 in the CAREWELL NURSING HOME at Dimapur with the pretext that if the complainant gave birth to any child before the accused could convince his parents she would never be accepted by Bodhisatta's parents and relatives further their marriage being a secret one, the developed stage of the complainant would hamper the dignity of her own parents and other paternal relations irreparably and thus taking the privilege of complainant innocency the accused has exploited the complainant in a very pre-planned way.",FAC
"
 The accused is so wicked that he even furnished a false name in the said Nursing Home and signed the consent Register/Paper as BIKASH GAUTAM concealing his real name BODHISATTA GAUTAM which fact was unknown to the innocent complainant until recently and came to know only in the 2nd week of February, 1995 when the complainant went to obtain a certified copy of the abortion consent paper of the accused.",FAC
"A copy of said consent paper signed by the accused in annexed hereto and marked as Annexure-1.
 11.",FAC
"That, believing her self to be the lawful wife of the accused, the complainant like a dumb shouldered up all those hardship since 1989.",FAC
"On hearing the massage that the accused would go to Silchar, the complainant on 4th Feb.'95 went down to Dimapur and visited the accused to take the complainant permanently with the accused to Silchar as he was going to Silchar to join as a Lecturer in a Government College named CACHAR COLLEGE which both of them actually waited for.",FAC
But the wicked accused       forgetting     the consequences of his all fraudulent activities in total disregards of their marriage and their relationship refused to accept the complainant as his wife and abandoned the complainant asking her to forget all her dream.,FAC
"Be it further submitted that the accused's friends namely (1) Shri Subrata Datta, (2) Shri Ranadhir Deb (3) Shri Prasanta Dey and (4) Shri Pradeep Paul of Dimapur tried a lot to convince the accused and not to abandon the complainant in such a cruel manner, as he had already married the complainant and cohabited years together, but all efforts ended in futility as the accused in reply said that the giving of vermilion on complainant's forehead was pretext of marriage to over come the past situations and not at all a complete marriage and the accused repeatedly said that he had no option, but to abandon the complainant as his parents are not agreeable to accept the complainant as their daughter-in-law.",FAC
"
 12. That, the accused not only induced the complainant and cohabited with her, giving her a false assurance of marriage but also fraudulently gave through certain marriage ceremony with knowledge that was not a valid marriage and thereby dishonestly made the complaint to believe that she was a lawfully married wife of the accused.",FAC
The accused even committed the offence of miscarriage by       compelling  the complainant to undergo abortion twice against her free will.,FAC
"The way the accused exploited the complainant and abandoned her is nothing but an act of grave cruelty as the same has caused serious injury and danger to the complainant's health both mentally and physically, as such, the accused above named has committed Criminal offences punishable U/S 312/420/493/496/498-A of Indian Penal Code.""",FAC
"This complaint was registered as Criminal Case No. 1/95 under Sections 312/420/493/496/498-A, Indian Penal Code and Bodhisattwa Gautam was summoned but he, in the meantime, filed a petition in the Gauhati High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing of the complaint and the proceedings initiated on its basis, on the ground that the allegations, taken at their face-value, do not make out any case against him.",FAC
"But the High Court by its judgment and order dated May 12, 1995.dismissed the petition compelling Bodhisattwa Gautam to approach this Court by way of Special Leave Petition.",FAC
"Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 2675/95 was filed and was dismissed by us by our order dated October 20, 1995, in which we stated as under :- ""We see no ground to interfere with the impugned judgment of the High Court.",FAC

"The facts set out in the complaint lodged against Bodhisattwa Gautam indicate that there was initially a period of romance during which Bodhisattwa Gautam used to visit the house of Subhra Chakraborty and on one occasion, he told her that he was in love with her and ultimately succeeded, on the basis of his assurances to marry her, in developing sexual relationship with her with the tragic result that Subhra Chakraborty became pregnant.",ANALYSIS
"While in that state, she persuaded Gautam to marry her, but he, deferred the proposal on the plea that he had to take his parents' permission.",ANALYSIS
"He, however, agreed to marry her secretly.",ANALYSIS
"Consequently, on 20th September, 1993, Bodhisattwa Gautam took her before the God he worshiped and put Vermilion on her forehead and accepted her as his lawful wife.",ANALYSIS
"In spite of the secret marriage, he, through his insistence, succeeded in motivating her for an abortion which took place in a clinic at Kohima in October, 1993.",ANALYSIS

 Subhra Chakraborty became pregnant second time and at the instance of Bodhisattwa Gautam she had to abort again in April, 1994 in the Carewell Nursing Home at Dimapur where Gautam signed the consent paper and deliberately mentioned himself as Bikash Gautam.",ANALYSIS

 The Gauhati High Court, as already pointed out above, refused to quash the proceeding in Criminal Case No 1/95 pending in the Court of the Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, Kohima and this Court has upheld the judgment of the Gauhati High Court.",FAC

 Rape is thus not only a crime against the person of a woman (victim), it is a crime against the entire society.",ANALYSIS
It destroys the entire psychology of a woman and pushed her into deep emotional crises.,ANALYSIS
"It is only by her sheer will power that she rehabilitates herself in the society which, on coming to know of the rape, looks down upon her in derision and contempt.",ANALYSIS
"Rape is, therefore, the most hated crime.",ANALYSIS
"It is a crime against basic human rights and is also violative of the victim's most cherished of the Fundamental Rights, namely, the Right to Life contained in Article 21.",ANALYSIS
"
To many feminists and psychiatrists, rape is less a sexual offence than an act of aggression aimed at degrating and humiliating women.",ANALYSIS
"The rape laws do not, unfortunately, take care of the social aspect of the matter and are inept in many respects.",ANALYSIS
"
 It is said that present days' law relating to rape have their origin in 1736 in Britain, when Sir Mathew Hale in his Historia Placitorum Cornea or, in other words, ""History of the pleas of the Crown"" presented common-law rape doctrines which were immediately noticed to be hostile to the interests of women as one of the requirement was to inform the jury during trial that rape charges were easy to bring but difficult to defend.",ANALYSIS
"Consequently, in a tide of law reforms, this requirement was removed.",ANALYSIS
The rule of corroboration which was much stricter in a trial for the offence of rape than for other offences was also largely removed from law.,ANALYSIS
"
 In India also the rule of ""Corroboration of the Prosecutrix"" has undergone a change through statutory amendments as also through decisions of this Court.",ANALYSIS
"
 In State of Himachal Pradesh vs. Raghubir Singh, 1993(2) SCC 622, this Court observed as under :- ""There is no legal compulsion to look for corroboration of the evidence of the prosecutrix before recording an order of conviction.",PRE_RELIED
Evidence has to be weighed and not counted.,PRE_RELIED
"Conviction can be recorded on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix, if her evidence inspires confidence and there is absence of circumstances which militate her veracity.",PRE_RELIED
In the present case the evidence of the prosecutrix is found to be reliable and trustworthy.,PRE_RELIED
"No corroboration was required to be looked for, though enough was available on the record.",PRE_RELIED
"The medical evidence provided sufficient corroboration.""",PRE_RELIED
"In State of Karnataka vs. Mahabaleshwar Gourya Naik, AIR 1992 SC 2043 = 1992 Suppl. (3) SCC 179, the Court went to the extent of laying down that even if the victim of rape is not available to give evidence on account of her having committed suicide, the prosecution case cannot be thrown away over board.",PRE_RELIED
"In such a case, the non-availability of the victim will not be fatal and the Court can record a conviction on the basis of the available evidence brought on record by the prosecution.",PRE_RELIED
"
         In spite of the decision of this Court that (depending upon the circumstances of the case) corroboration of the prosecutrix was not necessary, the cases continued to end in acquittal on account of mishandling of the crime by the police and the invocation of the theory of ""consent"" by the Courts who tried the offence.",ANALYSIS
"To overcome this difficulty, the legislature intervened and introduced Section 114-A in the Evidence Act by Act No. 43 of 1983 reading as under:- 114-A. Presumption as to absence of consent in certain prosecutions for rape.-",STA
"In a prosecution for rape under clause (a) or clause (b) or clause (c) or clause (d) or clause (e) or clause (g) or sub-section (2) of Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), where sexual intercourse by the accused is proved and the question is whether it was without the consent of the woman alleged to have been raped and she states in her evidence before the Court that she did not consent, the Court shall presume that she did not consent.""",STA
This Section enables a court to raise a presumption that the woman who was the victim of rape had not consented and that the offence was committed against her will.,ANALYSIS
"The situation, however, has hardly improved.",ANALYSIS
"Conviction rates for rape are still lower than any other major crime and the woman continue to argue even today that in rape cases the victimized women, rather than the rapists, were put on trial.",ANALYSIS
"A large number of women still fail to report rapes to the police because they fear embarrassing and insensitive treatment by the doctors, the law enforcement personnel and/or the cross-examining defence attorneys.",ANALYSIS
"The fear has to be allayed from the minds of women so that if and when this crime is committed, the victim may promptly report the matter to the police and on a chargesheet being submitted, the trial may proceed speedily without causing any embarrassment to the prosecutrix who may come in the witness box without fear psychosis.",ANALYSIS
"
 We may, at this stage, refer to a decision of this Court in Delhi Domestic Working Women's Forum vs. Union of India, 1995 (1) SCC 14, in which Court observed as under :- ""It is rather unfortunate that in recent times, there has been an increase in violence against women causing serious concern.",PRE_RELIED
Rape does indeed pose a series of problems for the criminal justice system.,PRE_RELIED
"There are cries for harshest penalties, but often times such crimes eclipse the real plight of the victim.",PRE_RELIED
"
 Rape is an experience which shakes the foundations of the lives of the victims.",PRE_RELIED
"
 For many, its effect is a long-term one, impairing their capacity for personal relationships, altering their behaviour values and generating and less fears.",PRE_RELIED
"In addition to the trauma of the rape itself, victims have had to suffer further agony during legal proceedings.""",PRE_RELIED
"
 This Court further observed as under :- ""The defects in the present system are : Firstly, complaints are handled roughly and are not even such attention as is warranted.",ANALYSIS
"The victims, more often than not, are humiliated by the police.",ANALYSIS
The victims have invariably found rape trials a traumatic experience.,ANALYSIS
The experience of giving evidence in court has been negative and destructive.,ANALYSIS
"The victims often say, they considered the ordeal to be even worse than the rape itself.",ANALYSIS
"Undoubtedly,         the court proceedings added to and prolonged the psychological stress they had had to suffer as a result of the rape itself.",ANALYSIS
"
 In this background, it is necessary to indicate the broad parameters in assisting the victims of rape.",ANALYSIS
"
(1) The complainants of sexual assault cases should be provided with legal representation.",ANALYSIS
It is important to have some one who is well-acquainted with the criminal justice system.,ANALYSIS
"The role of the victim's advocate would not only be to explain to the victim the nature of the proceedings, to prepare her for the case and to assist her in the police station and in court but to provide her with guidance as to how she might obtain help of a different nature from other agencies, for example, mind counselling or medical assistance.",ANALYSIS
It is important to secure continuity of assistance by ensuring that the same person who looked after the complainant's interests in the police station represent her till the end of the case.,ANALYSIS
"
(2) Legal assistance will have to be provided at the police station since the victim of sexual assault might very well be in a distressed state upon arrival at the police station, the guidance and support of a lawyer at this stage and whilst she was being questioned would be of great assistance to her.",ANALYSIS
"
(3) The police should be under a duty to inform the victim of her right to representation before any questions were asked of her and that the police report should state that the victim was so informed.",ANALYSIS
"
(4) A list of advocates willing to act in these cases should be kept at the police station for victims who did not have a particular lawyer in mind or whose own lawyer was unavailable.",ANALYSIS
"
(5) The advocate shall be appointed by the court, upon application by the police at the earliest convenient movement, but in order to ensure that victims were questioned without undue delay, advocates would be authorised to act at the police station before leave of the court was sought or obtained.",ANALYSIS
"
(6) In all rape trials anonymity of the victims must be maintained, as far as necessary.
(7) It is necessary, having regard to the Directive Principles contained under Article 38(1) of the Constitution of India to set up Criminal Injuries Compensation Board.",ANALYSIS
Rape victims frequently incur substantial financial loss.,ANALYSIS
"Some, for example, are too dramatized to continue in employment.",ANALYSIS
"
(8) Compensation for victims shall be awarded by the court on conviction of the offender and by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board whether or not a conviction has taken place.",ANALYSIS
"The Board will take into account pain, suffering and shock as well as loss of earnings due to pregnancy and the expenses of the child but if this occurred as a result of the rape.",ANALYSIS
"
 In the present situation, the third respondent will have to evolve such scheme as to wipe out the fears of such unfortunate victims.",ANALYSIS
Such a scheme shall be prepared within six months from the date of this judgment.,ANALYSIS
"Thereupon, the Union of India, will examine the same and shall take necessary steps for the implementation of the scheme at the earliest.""
         ",ANALYSIS
This decision recognises the right of the victim for compensation by providing that it shall be awarded by the Court on conviction of the offender subject to the finalisation of Scheme by the Central Government.,ANALYSIS
"If the Court trying an offence of rape has jurisdiction to award the compensation at the final stage, there is no reason to deny to the Court the right to award interim compensation which should also be provided in the Scheme.",ANALYSIS
"On the basis of principles set out in the aforesaid decision in Delhi Domestic Working Women's Forum, the jurisdiction to pay interim compensation shall be treated to be part of the over all jurisdiction of the Courts trying the offences of rape which, as pointed out above is an offence against basic human rights as also the Fundamental Right of Personal Liberty and Life.",ANALYSIS
"Apart from the above, this Court has the inherent jurisdiction to pass any order it consists fit and proper in the interest of justice or to do complete justice between the parties.
         ",ANALYSIS
"Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the present case in which there is a serious allegation that Bodhisattwa Gautam had married Subhra Chakraborty before the God he worshiped by putting Varmilion on her forehead and accepting her as his wife and also having impregnated her twice resulting in abortion on both the occasions, we, on being prima-facie satisfied, dispose of this matter by providing that Bodhisattwa Gautam shall pay to Subhra Chakraborty a sum of Rs. 1,000/- every month as interim compensation during the pendency of Criminal Case No. 1/95 in the court of Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Kohima, Nagaland.",RPC
He shall also be liable to pay arrears of compensation at the same rate from the date on which the complaint was filed till this date.,RPC

       Heard the learned counsel for the appellants and the learned State Public Prosecutor.",NONE
"2. The present appellants were accused before the Trial Court and have been convicted for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 148, 341, 326 read with 149 of Indian Penal Code, 1908.",RLC
3. The facts leading up to this appeal are:,NONE
" It was the case of the prosecution that Chidananda, the complainant, was a resident of Byragondanahalli Village.",FAC
He had gone to Arasikere on 23.2.2005 in order to see off his wife who was travelling in a bus and thereafter he was returning on his motorcycle at about 10.30 a.m.,FAC
"When he neared his village Bendekere, he saw a motor van bearing registration No.KA.14 3474 being driven at high speed on the wrong side of the road approaching him and therefore, he tried to avoid the vehicle by turning his motorcycle, but, however, accused No.1 Basavaraju who was driving the vehicle intercepted his motorcycle and dashed against him, as a result of which, plaintiff is said to have fallen to the ground.",FAC
"Thereafter, the accused had emerged from the motor van and on seeing them, the plaintiff picked himself up and started running, but accused No.1 Basavaraju who was holding an iron rod, chased him and assaulted him on the right leg with it, as a result of which the complainant fell to the ground at which time Dharanesha accused No.8 and Ramesha accused No.2 had assaulted him with wooden clubs and accused Nos.3 to 5 assaulted him with their hands.",FAC
"
 4. It was claimed by the prosecution that accused No.1 Basavaraju had stood for the Panchayat elections and one Ramesha was his rival candidate and the complainant had supported Ramesha at the elections.",FAC
"The accused were peeved by the fact that he had supported Ramesha and therefore, the pre- meditated attack on the victim.",FAC
"It is also stated that Basavaraju, apart from assaulting the victim with an iron rod, had picked up a size stone and attempted to drop it on the head of the complainant when he was lying on the ground, but for the complainant moving aside it would have been dropped on his head, however since he had raised his hands to protect himself, the stone fell on his right little finger and also left forehand, as a result of which, he had sustained injuries.",FAC
"At that point of time, it is stated that Kumaranna, Marulappa, Jagadeesha and Rajanna had come to his rescue and it is on seeing these people that the accused had fled in the car in which they had come.",FAC
"The complainant was shifted to Arasikere hospital for treatment and thereafter a statement was recorded by the Station House Officer on 23.2.2005 at about 11.30 a.m. and thereafter, further proceedings were taken, accused were arrested, chargesheeted and later charges were also framed against the accused to which they have pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.",FAC
"The Court below, after having heard both the parties and after complying with other proceedings, framed the following points for consideration: 1.",ISSUE
"""Whether the prosecution proves that on 23.2.2005 at about 10.30 p.m., near Nagasamudra Shikharanya High School situated at B.H.Road of Bendekere Village the accused persons had formed themselves into an unlawful assembly in order to commit the offences in prosecution of common object of such unlawful assembly and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 143 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code?",ISSUE
"2. Whether the prosecution proves that on the above said date, time and place in prosecution of common object of unlawful assembly the accused persons have committed rioting armed with deadly weapons and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 148 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code?",ISSUE
"3. Whether the prosecution proves that on the above said date, time and place in prosecution of common object of unlawful assembly have wrongfully restrained Chidananda from proceeding in the direction in which he has a right to proceed and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 341 read with Section 149 at Indian Penal Code?",ISSUE
"
   4. Whether the prosecution proves on the above said date, time and place in prosecution of common object of unlawful assembly have attempted to commit the murder of Chidananda and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 307 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code?""",ISSUE
"
 5. The Court below held point Nos.1 to 3 in the affirmative and point No.4 in the negative and convicted the accused to undergo simple imprisonment for three months and to pay a fine of `.100/- for the offence punishable under Section 143 of IPC, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months and to pay a fine of `.500/- for the offence punishable under Section 148 of IPC, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of `.500/- for the offence punishable under Section 341 of IPC and to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years and to pay a fine of `.1,000/- for the offence punishable under Section 326 of IPC.",RLC
It is this which is under challenge in the present appeal.,RLC
"
 6. The learned counsel for the appellants would first of all draw attention to the sequence of events as narrated, to demonstrate that the exaggerated version of the prosecution is not forthcoming from a bare reading of the allegations.",ARG_PETITIONER
"It is alleged that there were 8 accused, most of whom were armed with deadly weapons; that the victim was assaulted with the same.",ARG_PETITIONER
"Given the description of the weapons and the same which were produced as material objects, it is difficult to accept that the injuries caused were only in the nature of abrasions, which were minor in nature.",ARG_PETITIONER
"Except that an injury defined as a fracture is vaguely mentioned in the wound certificate, there is no material evidence placed on record to indicate that the victim had suffered any kind of fracture and there is also no material placed on record to indicate that the victim was an inpatient and had undergone treatment for any serious injury.",ARG_PETITIONER
"Though there is a claim that he was an inpatient, no material evidence is produced before the Court.",ARG_PETITIONER
"On the other hand, there is evidence on record to indicate that the victim had exercised his franchise at the elections held in the village, two days after the incident, which was against the statement that he was an inpatient for a week after the incident.",ARG_PETITIONER
"In this regard, though the learned counsel for the appellants would take this Court through the further details of the alleged incident as claimed by the prosecution to demonstrate that it was impossible for a large number of 8 people to have simultaneously attacked the victim and to only cause minor injuries, when most were armed with deadly weapons and therefore, would submit that there is a background which is not also in dispute of the victim having established a fair price depot and accused No.1 also having established a fair price depot and there being unhealthy competition between them and a case and counter case being filed for the irregularities in the fair price depot which lead to enemity between the two and further there being also political rivalry, it was just to foist a false case against the appellants in order to prevent their participation in the elections, that the entire case has been engineered and therefore, he would submit that the injuries which are described in the wound certificate are from a mere fall from a vehicle which has been used to the advantage of the victim in claiming that there was a criminal assault, as a result of which he has suffered the injuries and therefore, there is no substance in the same.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
 7. The learned counsel would also point out that the entire findings of the Trial Court are based on the evidence tendered by PW-6.",ARG_PETITIONER
"PW-6, in his evidence, has narrated that he was in his house when he heard the collusion and he had come out of the house at which time, the other witnesses namely PWs-2 and 4 who had also joined him and had witnessed the actual commission of the offence but the learned counsel would point out that if, going by the sequence of events, as claimed by the prosecution, if it is to be believed that PW-6 first heard the maruti van crashing into the motorcycle and on hearing the collision if he had come out, the assault by the accused if at all had occurred, would have been completed by the time he positioned himself to witness the scene.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
But he had claimed that, each of the witnesses had been in a position to record as to the overt acts committed by each of the accused.",ARG_PETITIONER
"This is difficult to accept, especially in the light of the circumstance that PWs-2 and 4 who also claimed to be witness to the incident, had not supported the case of the prosecution.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
Therefore, the entire prosecution case in so far as the allegation of the complainant being sought to be supported by the evidence of PW-6 cannot be accepted as enabling the prosecution to establish the case beyond all reasonable doubt.",ARG_PETITIONER
"In the absence of cogent medical evidence to support the so called serious injuries suffered by the victim and in the absence of cogent evidence in support of the case of the prosecution, except that of PW-6 and the self- serving evidence of the plaintiff, the prosecution has not established its case as found by the Trial Court and therefore, would submit that the conviction has lead to a miscarriage of justice and seeks intervention of the Court.",ARG_PETITIONER
While the learned State Public Prosecutor would seek to justify the judgment of the Trial Court.,ARG_PETITIONER
"8. In the light of the above rival contentions and from the material on record, as rightly contended by the learned counsel for the appellants, if the case of the prosecution is to be accepted and the accused having employed deadly weapons to attack the victim and if indeed he had been assaulted in the manner as claimed, the injuries suffered by the complainant would not have been restricted to mere abrasions.",ANALYSIS
"Though there is mention of a fracture which is only vaguely indicated in the wound certificate, there is no other material evidence as regard to the victim having suffered serious fracture.",ANALYSIS
"There is also no material evidence of the victim having undergone treatment as an inpatient, though the claim made by him in the course of evidence, it is unchallenged by the accused.",ANALYSIS
"Secondly, the sequence of events, as projected by the prosecution on the basis of the complainant's statement and which is sought to be supported by PW-6, does not also evoke the confidence of this Court for the manner in which the incident is stated to have occurred to be seconded by the statement of PW-6, is difficult to accept since the incident, if it had indeed taken place, would have occurred at a pace so swift that it would be difficult for an eye witness to record the overt acts of each of the 8 accused persons and to state the same with any degree of certainty.",ANALYSIS
"Therefore, it is difficult to accept that the moment the vehicle on which the victim was travelling was intercepted, PW-6 having run out of his house and having been in a position to witness the incident as it unravelled.",RATIO
"Therefore, it is evident that PW-6 has been cited as a witness, only to lend lip support to the case of the prosecution and going by the background that there was political enemity between the two groups, it is an apparent attempt to make out a case against the accused.",RATIO
"Therefore, given the sequence of events and the material on record, this Court does not find that the Trial Court was justified in convicting the accused for the offences alleged.",RATIO
"
 Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.",RPC

"
 This is a set of cross-appeals preferred by (i) Central Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter referred to as ""CBI""), and (ii) the convicts against the judgment dated 14th July, 2010 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench, Nagpur whereby five criminal appeals have been decided by way of a common order.",RLC
"While the CBI is aggrieved by the commutation of death sentence, the convicts (hereinafter referred to as the `respondentsaccused' in the lead case) have questioned their conviction by the Special Court as affirmed by the High Court.",NONE
"
 2) Firstly, a very brief reference to the facts may be made.",FAC
"Bhaiyyalal Sudam Bhotmange was residing on the outskirts of Khairlanji Village called as `Toli' with his wife Surekha, two sons, Sudhir and Roshan and one daughter, Priyanka.",FAC
They belong to Mahar caste (Scheduled Caste).,FAC
Siddharth Gajbhiye (PW-18) of nearby Village Dhusala was their family friend.,FAC
Siddharth Gajbhiye came to the house of Bhaiyyalal Sudam Bhotmange in the morning when Accused no. 2 (Sakru) met him and demanded back wages on account of which there arose a dispute and Siddharth Gajbhiye slapped Sakru.,FAC
"In the evening when Siddharth Gajbhiye was proceeding towards Kandri, he was assaulted by some villagers.",FAC
"Upon hearing the news of the assault, Surekha Bhotmange and Priyanka rushed to the spot and brought Siddharth Gajbhiye to their house.",FAC
"After two days, Siddharth Gajbhiye lodged a report at Andhalgaon Police Station pursuant to which Crime No. 52/06 was registered.",FAC
Surekha Bhotmange gave a statement identifying the persons who had assaulted Siddharth Gajbhiye.,FAC
"On the basis of that statement, the attackers were arrested.",FAC
"They were released on bail on 29th September, 2006.",FAC
"
 3) On 29th September, 2006 itself, at about 6.00 pm to 6.30 pm, a group of about 40 persons surrounded the house of Bhaiyyalal Sudam Bhotmange with some of them loudly implying that they were falsely implicated by Surekha.",FAC
"On seeing the crowd, Bhaiyyalal Sudam Bhotmange ran from the house whereas Surekha Bhotmange came out of the house and set fire to her cattle shed probably to ward off the attackers.",FAC
Then Surekha also tried to escape but she was chased and caught by the accused.,FAC
"She was assaulted with sticks, bicycle chains and kicks and fists.",FAC
"Sudhir, son of Bhaiyyalal Sudam Bhotmange, tried to run away but he too was caught and assaulted in the same manner as his mother.",FAC
His body was dragged near the body of Surekha who had already died.,FAC
All the accused then searched for other family members of Bhaiyyala Sudam Bhotmange.,FAC
They traced Roshan in the nearby cattle shed.,FAC
Roshan also tried to run away towards the hand pump but was unfortunately caught and he was assaulted in a manner alike his mother and brother.,FAC
The accused thereafter caught hold of Priyanka and beat her in the same fashion as described above.,FAC
"
Roshan and Priyanka also met with the same fate and they too died at the spot.",FAC
"The accused persons, thereafter, arranged for a bullock cart; took all four dead bodies therein and threw them in a canal.",FAC
"4) Bhaiyyalal Sudam Bhotmange, after running from his house, went to Dhusala and met Sidharth and narrated the incident.",FAC
Sidharth made a phone call to Andhalgaon Police Station.,FAC
"Thereafter, Bhaiyyalal Sudam Bhotmange, accompanied by the son of Siddharth, went to Andhalgaon Police Station but did not lodge any report as he was totally frightened.",FAC
"On the next morning, Bhaiyyalal Sudam Bhotmange went in search of his family members but could not trace them.",FAC
He then went to Andhalgaon Police station and lodged the report.,FAC
"By this time, the police had received information that the dead body of a girl with a tatoo mark `Priyanka' on the hand was found in a canal which was fished out.",FAC
Bhaiyyalal Sudam Bhotmange identified the dead body of Priyanka.,FAC
"On the same day, a case under Sections 120B, 147, 148, 149, 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code (for short, ""IPC"") read with Section 3(1)(x) of the Act was registered.",FAC
"
 5) The Sub-Divisional Police Officer arrested about eighteen persons on suspicion on 1st October, 2006 and on that very day, three more dead bodies of Surekha, Sudhir and Roshan Bhotmange were also found.",FAC
"Since the investigation was not being carried out properly, the State Government handed over the further probe to State C.I.D.",FAC
"
However, not much progress could be made by the State C.I.D. also, hence vide Notification dated 20th November, 2006, the State Government requested Union of India to hand over the investigation of the case to the C.B.I.",FAC
"The investigation was thereafter taken over by the CBI, who after recording statements of several witnesses including statements under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the `Code'), sought discharge of thirty six suspects and also submitted Charge-Sheet against the eleven accused for the offences punishable under Sections 147, 148, 149, 120B and 302 of the IPC and offences under the Act.",RLC
"
 6) The Special Court at Bhandara held the respondentsaccused guilty of committing the aforesaid offences and awarded death penalty to Accused nos. 2, 3 and 6 to 9 whereas Accused nos. 1 and 11 were sentenced with life imprisonment and Accused nos. 4, 5 & 10 were acquitted of all the offences.",RLC
"Accused nos. 1 to 3, 6 to 9 and 11 were not found guilty of committing any offence under the provisions of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (hereinafter referred to as the ""Act"").",RLC
The aforementioned judgment gave rise to five cross-appeals at the instance of CBI as well as the convicts besides Reference Case No. 4 of 2008 for the confirmation of death sentence.,FAC
"
 7) The High Court weighed the aggravating circumstances vis-a-vis mitigating circumstances as summarised in paragraphs 45 and 45A of its judgment under appeal, and came to the conclusion that in the light of the tests laid down by this Court in Bachan Singh vs. State of Punjab1 and Machhi Singh and Others vs. State of Punjab2, no case of imposing death sentence on Accused Nos. 2, 3 and 6 to 9 was made out for the reasons that (i) the incident did not take place on account of caste stature but the root cause was that the accused felt that they were falsely implicated in the crime of beating Sidharth Gajbhiye by Surekha and Priyanka; (ii) there is no evidence to suggest that the accused have a criminal record.
 8) The High Court, thereafter proceeded to hold that the most appropriate sentence to be inflicted upon the respondentsaccused should be imprisonment for life with a condition that they shall not be released before completing 25 years of actual imprisonment including the period already undergone by them.",RLC
"9) As regards the conviction of Accused nos. 1 to 3, 6 to 9 and 11 (who are in cross-appeals), the High Court firstly scrutinised the medical evidence and relying upon the statement of the Medical Officer, Dr. Avinash John Shende (PW-14) who conducted post-mortem on the dead bodies, it observed that the testimony of this witness could not be 1 (1980) 2 SCC684 2 (1983) 3 SCC470 shaken on any material aspect in the cross-examination.",RLC
The High Court thereafter held that all the four victims died homicidal death.,RLC
This conclusion was further corroborated by the inquest panchnama of the deceased persons.,RLC
"
 10) The High Court then dissected the entire oral evidence, especially the statements of five eye-witnesses.",RLC
"The evidence of PW-2 (Mukesh Pusam) and PW-3 (Suresh Khandate) was tested on the touchstone of probabilities whereupon the High Court held that their statements inspired confidence and established the role of accused Nos. 1 to 3, 6 to 9 and 11.",RLC
"The High Court also found the version of PW-5 (Rashtrapal Narnavare), PW-18 (Siddharth Gajbhiye), PW-19 (Dinesh Dhande) and PW-22 (Premlal Walke) worth credible and fully corroborative of the medical evidence to uphold the conviction of the above-mentioned accused.",RLC
"The High Court nevertheless disbelieved PW-20 (Mahadeo Zanzad) and also did not deem it necessary to bank upon the extra judicial confession allegedly made by Accused No. 2 (Sakru) before PW-10 (Anil Lede) and by Accused No. 8 (Jagdish Ratan Mandlekar) before PW-16 (Sunil Lede).
 11) Consequently, the High Court upheld the conviction of Accused Nos. 1 to 3, 6 to 9 and 11 though it allowed in part the appeal of Accused Nos. 2,3 and 6 to 9 to the extent that their death sentence was commuted to imprisonment for life with the condition that they shall not be released before completing 25 years of actual imprisonment.",RLC
"
 12) While the CBI has questioned the rejection of death reference by the High Court in the lead case, the respondentsaccused therein have filed the cross-appeals assailing their conviction by the courts below.",NONE
"
 13) The following questions, thus, fall for consideration in these appeals: (i) Whether the High Court was justified in commuting the death sentence to life imprisonment with a condition that the respondentsaccused shall have to undergo actual sentence of not less than 25 years?",ISSUE
"
 (ii) Whether the case in hand falls in the category of rarest of the rare cases and the offence(s) committed are of the gravest nature, such that no punishment less than the death sentence will suffice?",ISSUE
"
 (iii) Whether the conviction of appellants in the cross-appeals, namely, the respondentsaccused in the main case is sustainable in law?",ISSUE
"
 14) We have heard learned counsel for the parties at a considerable length on the questions formulated above and have also gone through the relevant record with their assistance.
 15) The Constitution Bench of this Court in Bachan Singh (supra), while upholding the constitutional validity of death penalty for murder as provided in Section 302 IPC and the sentencing procedure embodied in Section 354(3) of the Code, also elucidated the principles to be adhered to by the courts in the matter of award of death sentence.",ANALYSIS
"This Court emphatically expressed that the courts will discharge the onerous function with evermore scrutiny and care and will be guided by the legislative policy outlined in Section 354(3) of the Code, viz., for persons convicted of murder, life imprisonment is the `rule' and death sentence an `exception'.",ANALYSIS
The court thus viewed that `a real and abiding concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law's instrumentality.,ANALYSIS
That ought to be done save in the rarest of rare case when the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed'.,ANALYSIS
"
 16) In Machhi Singh and others (supra), this Court postulated the following two questions to be considered as a test to determine the `rarest of rare' cases in which death sentence can be inflicted: (a) Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence?
 (b) Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender?",ANALYSIS
"
 17) Machhi Singh and others (supra) further summarised the guidelines emanating from Bachan Singh's (supra), though to be applied to the facts of each individual case and thus it ruled that: ""(i) The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability.",ANALYSIS
"
 (ii) Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the `offender' also require to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the `crime'.",ANALYSIS
"
 (iii) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception.",ANALYSIS
"Death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime, and provided, and only provided, the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances.
 (iv) A balance-sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances has to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised.""
 18) It goes without saying that the parameters evolved in Bachan Singh's (supra) and Machhi Singh's (supra) have been consistently followed by the Courts depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case wherever the question of imposition of death sentence has arisen.
 19) On an indepth consideration of the facts and the circumstances in which the ghastly crime of taking away the lives of four innocent persons took place, we find that the High Court was fully conscious of the binding principles illustratively laid down by this Court in the cited decisions and after carefully drawing the balance-sheet of `aggravating' and `mitigating' circumstances, the High Court rightly deemed it appropriate that the instant case does not fall amongst the exceptional category of `rarest of the rare' cases where the extreme penalty of death and death alone must be inflicted.
 20) It needs no elaborate discussion that the judicial discretion conferred upon a Court in the matter of awarding sentence is an onerous duty which has to be exercised keeping in view the settled and binding dictates including the Doctrine of Proportionality for assigning justifiable reasons to award death penalty and also to keep in mind the Doctrine of Reform and Rehabilitation.",ANALYSIS
"[Ref: Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar Vs. State of Maharashtra3].
 21)",ANALYSIS
"We cannot be oblivious of the fact that the High Court in the instant case was alive to the question of the adequacy of sentence and has not commuted the death sentence into life imprisonment, as understood in the ordinary parlance to be a term of 14 years imprisonment only.",ANALYSIS
"The High Court, following the evolution of a new concept of sentencing conceptualized by this Court in Swamy Shraddananda (2) Alias Murali Manohar Mishra vs. State of Karnataka4 and several other previous decisions, has held that the respondentsaccused shall not be released from prison unless they complete 25 years of actual sentence.",ANALYSIS
"
 22) This Court in Swamy Shraddananda (2) (supra) has held that the punishment of imprisonment for life ""means a sentence of imprisonment for the convict in the rest of his life"".",ANALYSIS
It was explained that Section 57 of the IPC does not in any way limit the punishment of imprisonment for life to a term of 20 years.,ANALYSIS
"After explaining the true import of Sections 432, 433 and 433A of the Code, the Court very aptly explained the two aspects of sentencing.",ANALYSIS
"In a given case, the sentence may be excessively and unduly harsh or it may be highly 3 (2009) 6 SCC 498 4 (2008) 13 SCC 767 disproportionately inadequate where the Court comes to the conclusion that the case falls short of the `rarest of the rare' category and thus may feel reluctant in endorsing the death sentence.",ANALYSIS
"It was thus viewed that a far more just, reasonable and proper course would be to expand the options and to take over, as a matter of fact what lawfully belongs to the court, namely, the formalization of `special category' of sentence of more than 14 years' actual imprisonment.",ANALYSIS
"
 23) The doubts, if any, as regards to the powers of the High Court or this Court in awarding a `special sentence' as a substitute for death sentence, have been set at rest by the Constitution Bench in Union of India Vs. V. Sriharan Alias Murugan and others5, affirming the view taken in Swamy Shraddananda (2) (supra) and holding that: ""105. ...xx......xx.......xx.... the power derived from the Penal Code for any modified punishment within the punishment provided for in the Penal Code for such specified offences can only be exercised by the High Court and in the event of further appeal only by the Supreme Court and not by any other court in this country.",ANALYSIS
"To put it differently, the power to impose a modified punishment providing for any specific term of incarceration or till the end of the convicts life as an alternate to death penalty, can be exercised only by the High Court and the Supreme Court and not by any other inferior court.",ANALYSIS
"
                106",ANALYSIS
". Viewed in that respect, we state that the ratio laid down in Swamy Shraddananda (2)4 that a special category of sentence; instead of death; for a term exceeding 14 years and put that category beyond application of remission is well 5 (2016) 7 SCC 1 founded and we answer the said question in the affirmative.
                ",ANALYSIS
"We are, therefore, not in agreement with the opinion expressed by this Court in Sangeet vs. State of Haryana that the deprival of remission power of the appropriate as not permissible is not in consonance with the law and we specifically overrule the same.""",PRE_NOT_RELIED
"
 24) The recourse followed in the case in hand by the High Court in substituting the death penalty by imposing the sentence for a term not less than 25 years' actual imprisonment has got the seal of approval of this court in V. Sriharan (supra) case, which has been consistently and continuously followed in a catena of later decisions also.",PRE_RELIED
[Ref. (i) Raju Jagdish Paswan vs. The State of Maharashtra ; 2019 (1) SCALE 735; (ii) Jagdish Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh; 2019(3) SCALE 888 & (iii) Sachin Kumar Singhraha vs. State of Madhya Pradesh; 2019(5)SCALE 39] 25) The cited decisions have indeed more intuitive and persuasive value in the instant case for the reason that the death sentence in those cases was commuted regardless of its confirmation by the High Court(s).,PRE_RELIED
"In the present case, the High Court itself did not find it a fit case to affirm the death sentence.",ANALYSIS
"We, therefore, see no reason to take a view different than the High Court.",ANALYSIS
Question Nos. (i) and (ii) stand answered accordingly.,ANALYSIS
"
 26) Adverting to the cross-appeals preferred by the respondents accused, their Learned Counsel strenuously urged that it is a fit case for extending the benefit of doubt for:--(i) the statements of eye- witnesses (PW-2, PW-3, PW-17, PW-19 and PW-22) do not inspire confidence and are full of material inconsistencies and contradictions; (ii) there has been inordinate and unexplained delay of 22-26 hours in lodging the FIR by Bhaiyyalal Sudam Bhotmange (PW-17); (iii) there is also an unexplained delay in recording the statements of witnesses, especially the eye-witnesses which is fatal to the prosecution case; (iv) the medical evidence is at variance with the ocular testimony, hence no reliance can be placed on the statements of eye-witnesses; and that (v) the prosecution evidence is tainted and full of discrepancies.",ARG_RESPONDENT
"
 27) Having pondered over the above summarized submissions, we do not find any substance therein.",ANALYSIS
"We say so for the reasons that Dr.
Avinash John Shende (PW-14) who conducted the post-mortem on the dead bodies of the victims found multiple `external' injuries sustained by them as reproduced by the High Court in paragraphs 15 to 16C of the impugned judgment.",ANALYSIS
All those injuries were ante-mortem and each victim had suffered two or more injuries on vital parts of their respective bodies.,ANALYSIS
All such injuries were found sufficient enough to have caused death in the ordinary course of nature.,ANALYSIS
"On `internal' examination of the dead bodies of the victims, PW- 14 found hemorrhage under the scalp in the cases of all the victims, caused mostly due to head injuries.",ANALYSIS
"In the case of Surekha Bhotmange, the medical evidence further suggested that some of the injuries were caused by sharp edged weapons.",ANALYSIS
"His evidence coupled with the inquest panchanama (Exhibits 86, 87, 88 and 91), unequivocally establishes that all the four victims died a homicidal death.",ANALYSIS
"
 28) There is an eye-witness account consisting of statements of PW- 2, PW-3, PW-19, PW-20 and PW-22.",ANALYSIS
Each one of them had witnessed the occurrence and identified most of the assailants.,ANALYSIS
They also elaborated as to how the four hapless victims were brutally killed with premeditated intent.,ANALYSIS
"Both the courts below have evaluated the statements of eye-witnesses with specific reference to the minor discrepancies except that the High Court has declined to rely upon the statement of Mahadeo Zanzad (PW-20), and rightly so, as he had made a false statement to the Magistrate for which he was prosecuted and convicted.",ANALYSIS
"Even after discarding the version of this witness in entirety there is overwhelming oral evidence on record, the testimony whereof could not be impeached in cross-examination, to establish the guilt of the respondentaccused beyond any doubt.",ANALYSIS
"There is no reason to falsely implicate the respondentsaccused, more so, when there is not even a whisper that any of the witnesses had an axe to grind against the convicts.",ANALYSIS
"Similarly, the statement of Bhaiyyalal Sudam Bhotmange (PW-17) with respect to the motive of the crime cannot be discarded merely because he is the husband or the father of the victims.",ANALYSIS
"Relationship, per-se, is not a factor to affect the credibility of a witness.",ANALYSIS
"
 29) The delay of some hours in registration of the FIR has also been convincingly explained by the complainant--Bhaiyyalal Sudam Bhotmange (PW-17) and Siddharth Gajbhiye (PW-18).",ANALYSIS
"Where the prosecution has satisfactorily explained the cause of delay in the registration of FIR, there is no rhyme or reason for a court to look at the prosecution case with suspicious eyes.",ANALYSIS
"The plea of so-called delay in recording the statements of the witnesses, is to be merely noticed and rejected.",ANALYSIS
"It has come on record that the investigation was not carried out properly by the local police, therefore, the State Government handed over the case to the State CID.",ANALYSIS
"No effective progress could be made by the State CID also, hence the investigation was entrusted to CBI.",ANALYSIS
It is thereafter that the statements of several witnesses including under Section 164 of the Code were recorded.,ANALYSIS
The long drawn process has caused no prejudice to the respondentsaccused.,ANALYSIS
"
 30) There are concurrent findings of facts by the Special Court as well as the High Court holding Accused Nos. 1 to 3, 6 to 9 and 11 guilty.",RATIO
"
Regardless of the restrictive scope of further re-appraisal and re- appreciation of the evidence, we have minutely scanned the ocular as well as medical evidence and are of the firm view that there is no scope of deviation from the well-reasoned conclusions drawn by the courts below.",RATIO

"1. This is a petition seeking leave to appeal against the impugned judgment dated 14th February 2013 passed by Special Judge, NDPS in Sessions Case No. 18A/08 acquitting the Respondent of the offences under Sections 21 and 27A of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (‘NDPS Act’).
 2.",FAC
"The case of the prosecution is that on 6th October 2007 an intelligence was gathered by Shri Diwakar Joshi, (PW1), an Intelligence Officer of Directorate of Revenue (DRI), through a reliable source that the Respondent, carrying narcotic drugs, would be coming in a Bolero Jeep at HP Petrol Pump, Mahipal Pur, near Radisson Hotel, New Delhi, at around 10.00 p.m.",FAC
"The intelligence was reduced to writing, placed before the senior officer Shri Sanjay Bansal (PW2), who directed Shri N.D. Azad (PW9) to immediately organise a team for surveillance and interception of the person along with the contraband substance.",FAC
"
 3. After associating two public witnesses, the DRI officers are stated to have left their office at 8.00 p.m. and reached the petrol pump at about 9.00 p.m.
 ",FAC
"At around 10.30 p.m., the Bolero jeep arrived at the petrol pump and was immediately intercepted.",FAC
"The driver of the jeep was the Respondent, who happened to be a resident of Village Sammipur in District Jalandhar, Punjab.",FAC
"
 4. The case of the prosecution is that although the Respondent initially denied carrying any narcotic substance, on persistent questioning by the team, he admitted that he was carrying approximately 5 kgs of Heroin concealed in a greenish colour VIP suitcase lying in the boot of the jeep.",FAC
Notice under Section 50 of the NDPS Act (Ex. PW11/B) was given to the Respondent at the spot and he gave a reply in writing on the said notice in his handwriting that he did not require any Magistrate or Gazetted Officer for the search proceedings and that it could be undertaken by any officer of the DRI.,FAC
"It is also stated that at the request of the accused, a search was effected at a secure place away from the place of interception.",FAC
"From the suitcase, two packets weighing 2.438 kgs and 2.346 kgs were recovered.",FAC
A personal search of the accused was also conducted and recovery of cash of Rs. 1.98 lakhs and one mobile phone with one sim card was made.,FAC
Three representative samples were taken from the packets.,FAC
"On testing, the sample showed the presence of diacetylmorphine of 60.4% and 57.7% purity respectively.",FAC
"
 5. The case of the prosecution is that a detailed panchnama (Ex. PW11/A) was prepared with regard to the interception, search and seizure.",FAC
"Further, it was stated that in response to the summons issued to the accused under Section 67 of the NDPS Act (PW11/C), the accused appeared and tendered his voluntary statement (PW11/D).",FAC
He disclosed that the owner of a stand at Jalandhar used to send the vehicle on hire to one Bittoo.,FAC
"On 6th October 2007, Bittoo called the Respondent at around 1.00 p.m. at BMC Chowk, Jalandhar and had given him the VIP suit case in question and Rs. 2 lakhs and asked him to go to Delhi and deliver it near the Radisson Hotel.",FAC
"The accused was promised to be paid Rs. 6,000/- as charges for the delivery and Rs. 500 for the payment of toll.",FAC
"From the sum of Rs. 2 lakhs, he spent Rs.
 2000/- on diesel.",FAC
"However, the Respondent did not give the DRI Officers any contact number or address of Bittoo.",FAC
"
 6. In the impugned judgment after discussing the entire prosecution evidence, the learned trial court has come to the following conclusions: i. Section 50 of the NDPS Act was contravened in as much as the notice issued under that provision, Ex. PW11/B, to the accused at the spot appeared to be a fake document, created and manufactured after the alleged time of interception.",RLC
"
 ii. Sections 41 and 42 of the NDPS Act were not complied with since the Investigating Officer (IO) (PW11) did not possess a valid authorisation to effect the seizure.",RLC
The authorisation was given by PW2 Sanjay Bansal in favour of PW9 Shri N.D. Azad who in turn authorised Shri Devender Singh (PW7).,RLC
"However, PW7 Devender Singh was neither the seizing officer nor a member of the raiding team of DRI.",RLC
The seizure of this case was effected by PW11 Shri K. Shashi Bhushan in whose favour there was no authorization.,RLC
"
 Merely because PW9 was himself a member of the raiding party, it would not obviate the need for a valid authorisation in favour of PW11 to carry out the seizure.",RLC
"
 iii. Section 43 of the NDPS Act would not apply since the seizure was effected not by way of chance recovery but on the basis of specific prior information.
 iv.",RLC
The summons issued to the Respondent under Section 67 of NDPS Act appeared to be a document prepared and manipulated subsequent to the search and seizure from the accused.,RLC
"While the retraction application of the Respondent was in Punjabi, his statement was in Hindi of poor quality and this raised further doubts as to its genuineness.",RLC
v. The failure to associate public witnesses in the search and seizure raised sufficient doubts as to their genuineness; there were also doubts regarding the site plan; the issuance of the seal of DRI by PW10 in favour of PW11 and the very constitution of the raiding team.,RLC
"
 vi. The failure to produce the necessary certification regarding the mobile phone recovered from the Respondent also contributed to the weakening of the prosecution case against the Respondent.",RLC
"
 vii.",RLC
The accused could not be found guilty under Sections 27 and 27 A of the NDPS Act merely because of the recovery of cash of Rs. 1.98 lakhs.,RLC
"
 7. Mr. Satish Aggarwala, Senior Standing Counsel for DRI submitted that since the recovery was made from the vehicle there was no need for issuance of notice under Section 50 of the NDPS Act and, therefore, the finding of the learned trial court in that behalf was erroneous.",ARG_PETITIONER
8. This Court is unable to agree with the above submissions.,ANALYSIS
In the present case a personal search was also made of the body of the accused.,ANALYSIS
A notice under Section 50 NDPS Act had therefore to be mandatorily issued.,ANALYSIS
"
 9. What is however, disconcerting is that the details recorded in this notice were contrary to what was deposed by the prosecution witness, as to what transpired on 6th October 2007.",ANALYSIS
The notice under Section 50 (Ex. PW11/B) mentions the time of occurrence as around “11.30 hrs. today” which was 6th October 2007.,ANALYSIS
In the absence of any indication that it was ‘p.m.’ or ‘a.m.’ it could well be taken to be ‘a.m’.,ANALYSIS
"Even if it was taken to be p.m., it contradicted the case of the prosecution that the accused was apprehended at around 10.30 p.m.",ANALYSIS
The second factor pointed out is that a typed notice could not possibly have been served at the time and place of apprehension of the accused.,ANALYSIS
There was nothing to show that the raiding party took any computer with them from which a typed notice could have been prepared at the spot.,ANALYSIS
"
 These factors indicate that the notice Ex. PW11/B was a document prepared subsequently.",ANALYSIS
"There is no satisfactory explanation for the above glaring discrepancies concerning the notice issued to the accused under Section 50 of the NDPS Act.
 10.",ANALYSIS
"As regard the non-compliance with provisions of Sections 41 and 42 of the NDPS Act, the submission of Mr. Aggarwala is that since the seizure was effected from a vehicle in transit in a public place, Section 43 of the Act that would at best apply and not Sections 41 and 42.",ARG_PETITIONER
"As pointed out by the learned trial court, since the interception took place upon receipt of specific intelligence and not by way of chance recovery and by assembling a team of officers, it was a mandatory requirement to comply with Sections 41 and 42 of the NDPS Act.",ANALYSIS
The reliance placed in this regard by Mr. Aggarwala on the decisions in Ramesh Kumar Rajput v. State 11 (2008) DLT (Crl) 828 and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence v. Mohammad Nisar Holia (2008) 2 SCC 370 is to no avail since both the decisions are distinguishable on facts.,ANALYSIS
"
 In any event, in the latter case a distinction was drawn between recovery from a public place on receipt of specific information in advance and a recovery by chance.",ANALYSIS
The rigours of the law might not apply.,ANALYSIS
"In the present case, however, the recovery from the vehicle on a public highway was not as a matter of pure chance but on specific advance information and therefore the requirements of Sections 41 and 42 of the NDPS Act had to be complied with.",ANALYSIS
"
 11. Further the mere fact that PW9 went along with the raiding party did not mean that he was not required to authorise the officer who in fact effected the seizure.",ANALYSIS
The seizure in the case was effected by PW11 who was required to be specifically authorised to do so.,ANALYSIS
"The fact of the matter was that there was no specific authorisation in favour of PW11.
 12.",ANALYSIS
"As regards non-compliance with Section 67 of the NDPS Act, Mr.
 Aggarwala submitted that it was possible for the DRI to have served upon the accused summons on 6th October 2007 itself requiring him to appear before the DRI at 7.00 a.m. on 7th October 2007 for the purpose of recording his statement.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
 13. The above submission overlooks the glaring inconsistencies pointed out by the learned trial court as regards the summons, Ex. PW11/C.",ANALYSIS
"Although it was dated 6th October 2007, the fact of the matter is that the panchnama proceedings concluded at 10.00 a.m. only on 7th October 2007.",ANALYSIS
"The question of accused appearing at 7.00 a.m. on 7th October 2007, therefore, simply did not arise.",ANALYSIS
The finding of the trial court that the said summons could never have been served on the accused on 6th October 2007 and that the said document was possibly prepared subsequently cannot be faulted.,ANALYSIS
"
 14. The careful examination of the record also bears out that the other findings of the learned trial court in the impugned judgment are detailed and reasoned.",RATIO
"
 15. The Court is unable to find any valid ground for granting leave to appeal against the impugned judgment.",RATIO
"Accordingly, the petition is dismissed with no order as to costs.",RPC
"
 16. The trial Court record be sent back forthwith.",RPC

"Petitioner who has been arraigned as accused in Crime No.177 of 2015 of Ranebennur Town Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections 363 and 376 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 is before this Court seeking for being released on bail.",FAC
"2. A complaint came to be lodged by one Sri.Anilkumar before Ranebennur Town Police Station alleging that he had a sister by name Smt.Manjula and she was married to one Sri.Puttanna Ganiger and out of their wedlock, one son and a daughter were born and about 15 years back, his sister Smt.Manjula had expired and as such, he was taking care of the daughter of Smt.Manjula, namely Kum.Vijayalakshmi and she was staying in KLES Hostel, Ranebennur and was visiting their house only during school holidays and festivals.",FAC
"It is stated that on 12th December 2015 at about 06.00 p.m., he received a phone call  from  Smt.Leelavati  Fakiragouda Kenchanagoudra, warden of the hostel, stating that from 09.45 a.m., Kum.Vijayalakshmi was not to be seen in the hostel and as such, he went to the Hostel and searched for her and made enquiries with the relatives and suspecting that petitioner had kidnapped her, he sought for suitable action being taken by lodging a complaint, which came to be registered in Crime No.177 of 2015 under Section 363 of the Indian Penal Code.",FAC
"
 3. It is the contention of Sri.M.H.Patil, learned counsel appearing for petitioner, that a false complaint has been registered against petitioner out of ill-will and now, investigation is concluded and charge-sheet has been filed and as such, petitioner's custodial interrogation would not be required and as such, he seeks for petitioner being enlarged on bail, since he is in custody from 16th December 2015.",ARG_PETITIONER
Petitioner undertakes to abide by any conditions that would be imposed on him.,ARG_PETITIONER
"
 4.  Per contra, learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for respondent  State has opposed grant of prayer and by relying upon the charge-sheet material, he would contend that offences alleged against petitioner is under Section 376 of Indian Penal Code and under the provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, which are serious in nature and if petitioner is released on bail, he may tramper with prosecution witnesses and may also abscond from the jurisdiction of the Court.",ARG_RESPONDENT
"Hence, he prays for rejection of the petition.",ARG_RESPONDENT
"
 5.  Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and on perusal of records, it would indicate that warden of the Hostel where victim girl was studying has given a statement to the investigating officer and she has categorically stated that on the date victim girl was absconding, she had found a letter written by her about her intention to commit suicide and as such, she ran away from the hostel.",ANALYSIS
"She has also stated that immediately, she had informed the guardian of victim girl namely the complainant about this fact.",ANALYSIS
Statement made under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the victim girl before the jurisdictional Magistrate would also indicate that it was the victim girl who was contacting petitioner over phone quite often and she had eloped with petitioner on 11th December 2015.,ANALYSIS
She has not stated that he had forced her to elope with her.,ANALYSIS
"
 6. Forensic Science Laboratory report, which was made available by the learned High Court Government Pleader, would indicate that seminal stains were not detected on vaginal swab, perennial swab, pubic hairs, under garments, pubic heirs, swab from penis and under garments.",ANALYSIS
"
 Likewise, veginal secretions were also not detected on item Nos.7, 8 and 9 i.e., on pubic hairs, swab from penis and under garments, on medical examination by Forensic Science Laboratory experts.",ANALYSIS
"
 7. Letter written by victim girl produced by the warden of hostel would disclose that she had indicated thereunder that she was going to commit suicide.",RATIO
"The contention of Sri.M.H.Patil, learned counsel appearing for petitioner, that when the statement of victim girl made before the jurisdictional Magistrate under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is to the effect that she was in love with petitioner and she herself had threatened the petitioner to take her away for getting married, would probabilise the theory of petitioner at this stage.",RATIO
Said contention deserves to be accepted at this stage.,RATIO
"In the light of medical evidence available on record, this Court is of the considered view that petitioner is entitled for the relief as sought for.",RATIO

2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned HCGP for the respondent.,FAC
"Perused the first information report, charge sheet and other papers produced along with the petition.",FAC
"
 3. Learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that two cases have been registered against the petitioner in crime Nos.27/2003 for the offences punishable under Sections 14, 32 read with Section 34 of Karnataka Excise Act and in crime No.137/2003 for the offences punishable under Sections 11, 14, 32, 34 and 38A of Karnataka Excise Act.",ARG_PETITIONER
He had obtained bail in both cases from the jurisdictional Magistrate.,ARG_PETITIONER
"Due to personal inconvenience, the petitioner had not attended the cases.",ARG_PETITIONER
"Consequently, the trial Court cancelled the bail.",RLC
"The petitioner, being aggrieved by the cancellation of bail by the trial Court, applied for a fresh bail before the Sessions Court in Criminal Misc. Case No.743/2016 in respect of crime No.137/2003 and Criminal Misc.
Case No.779/2016 in respect of Crime No.27/2003.",FAC
"
The learned Counsel submits that Criminal Misc. Case No.743/2016 came up for consideration before the II Additional District and Sessions Judge, D.K., Mangaluru and the said Court was pleased to allow the petition and granted bail considering the fact that the petitioner's father was seriously ill, whereas Criminal Misc. Case No.779/2016 came up for consideration before the III Additional District and Sessions Judge, D.K., Mangaluru and the learned Judge rejected the bail application on the ground that the petitioner is in the habit of violating the conditions of the bail and no grounds are made out for grant of bail in his favour.",FAC
"The learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that henceforth, the petitioner would attend both cases regularly and he would not violate the conditions of bail and as a last chance, sympathy may be shown to the petitioner and he may be granted bail.",ARG_PETITIONER
He submits that petitioner's father is seriously ill and there is nobody to look after his father.,ARG_PETITIONER
"Hence, he prays for allowing the petition by granting bail to the petitioner.",ARG_PETITIONER
4. Learned HCGP opposes the bail petition on the ground that petitioner has violated conditions of bail on more than one occasion and therefore the Sessions Court was justified in rejecting his bail application.,ARG_RESPONDENT
"
Therefore, he submits that if the petitioner is granted bail, he would repeat the same thing and he would not appear before the Trial Court.",ARG_RESPONDENT
"Therefore, he sought for rejection of the bail petition.",ARG_RESPONDENT
"
 5. As already stated, there are two cases registered by the police against the petitioner in Crime Nos.27/2003 and 137/2003.",ANALYSIS
Crime No.27/2003 is registered as CC No.1854/2016 whereas Crime No.137/2003 is registered as CC No.1750/2016 and both are pending on the file of the Jurisdictional Magistrate.,ANALYSIS
It is an admitted case of the petitioner that he has violated the conditions of bail in both cases.,ANALYSIS
"
Consequently the Jurisdictional Magistrate has cancelled the bail in both the cases.",ANALYSIS
"Therefore, he had filed two bail petitions in Criminal Misc. Case Nos.743/2016 and 779/2016.",ANALYSIS
Criminal Misc. Case No.743/2016,ANALYSIS
"came up consideration before II Additional District and Sessions Judge, D.K., Mangaluru the learned Judge allowed the petition and granted bail considering the case of the petitioner sympathetically on the ground that his father is seriously ill.",ANALYSIS
"Whereas, Criminal Misc. Case Nos.779/2016 came up consideration before the III Additional District and Sessions Judge, D.K., Mangaluru.",ANALYSIS
The learned Judged viewed violation of condition of bail by the petitioner very seriously and cancelled bail granted to the petitioner in both the cases.,ANALYSIS
"Considering the fact that petitioner's father is seriously ill, he has been granted bail in one case and request for bail was rejected in another case.",RATIO
Unless he is granted bail in another case also bail granted to him in Criminal Misc. Case No.743/2016 would not enure to his benefit.,RATIO
"Therefore, I deem it just and proper to grant bail to the petitioner in the other case also.",RATIO
6. The petition is allowed.,RPC

"
 Hereinafter the status of the parties will be referred to as arrayed in the original suit.",NONE
"
 2. I.A. 1 is filed by the Plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 of C.P.C. praying to grant an order of ad-interim Temporary Injunction restraining the Defendants, their agents, servants or anybody acting on their behalf from alienating the 'A' schedule property pending disposal of the suit.",FAC
"
 3. The brief facts of the case of the Plaintiff are that, the 3rd Defendant is an Income Tax and Wealth Tax Assessee.",FAC
The Income Tax and Wealth Tax returns reveal the particulars of Assets and Liabilities of 3rd Defendant from the year 1969-70 onwards.,FAC
"The existing tax liability of the 3rd Defendant to the Income Tax Department is to an extent of Rs.50,00,000/- and interest thereon.",FAC
"Mahanth P.Krishnandagiri Goswamy, the then Mahanth of the 3rd Defendant had been filed returns of Income Tax and Wealth Tax on behalf of 3rd Defendant.",FAC
All the returns were signed and verified by him during his lifetime.,FAC
The entire income belonged to 3rd Defendant Mutt and none of it belonged to Mahanth P.Krishnandagiri Goswamy in his individual capacity.,FAC
He failed to furnish the books of accounts.,FAC
It was concluded that entire income belonged to the said person under his individual capacity and none of it belonged to the Trust.,FAC
"Since ""status"" issue was under dispute, protective assessments were made in the name of 3rd Defendant.",FAC
He had declared the suit schedule properties as the assets of 3rd Defendant.,FAC
The Assessments pertaining to the period 1969- 70 to 1985-86 were concluded in the hands of Mahant P.Krishnandagiri Goswamy.,FAC
The Mahanth contended that assets and consequential income belonged to the 3rd Defendant.,FAC
"Whether the properties belonged to the deceased Mahant in individual capacity or it is owned by the Mutt, the Wealth Tax liability and Income Tax liability was for the accrued Wealth and Income derived out of the said properties as such to whom so ever the ownership passes, that person is liable to pay the tax arrears.",FAC
"It is further contended that, the said Mahant clearly expressed that he had no taxable wealth or income in his individual capacity, as such he was not filing any returns.",FAC
Hence the Trust was assessed in the status of A.J.P.,FAC
The demand notices were issued to him for the recovery of dues since he was representing the Trust during his lifetime.,FAC
"When the Tax was not paid after receipt of notice, the Plaintiff issued the order of attachment of immovable properties including the suit schedule property.",FAC
"In I.T.""C"" 16 dated 13.9.1988 for Rs.13,50,802/- and also other arrears in respect of Certificate No.81-X dated 24.3.1988 and thereby prohibited and restrained the 3rd Defendant's Mahant P.Krishnandagiri Goswamy from transferring or charging the attached property, in any way and that all persons were prohibited from enjoying any benefit under such transfer until further order of the Tax Recovery Officer, Mysore Circle.",FAC
"
 4. It is further contended that since the said Mahant did not pay off the arrears of tax during his life time, after his death, the Plaintiff issued order of attachment of immovable property dated 3.5.1995 to his successor-in-office in the Mutt.",FAC
The said order was served on the 3rd Defendant.,FAC
"
""Notice of Demand"" U/s. 156 of the Income Tax Act 1961 was issued on 12.8.2001.",FAC
Thereafter the Plaintiff published the fact of attachment of the above said properties and copy of the attachment order was displayed in the notice board of the Income Tax Office.,FAC
The 1st Defendant is the brother of deceased Mahanth and has claimed to be the legal heir of the said Mahant.,FAC
"After the death of the said Mahant, the 1st Defendant is indulged in selling of the properties of the 3rd Defendant's Mutt.",FAC
The 3rd Defendant has also sold one of the properties under attachment.,FAC
"The Plaintiff already filed a suit in O.S.No. 933/2002 against the 1st Defendant and others before the 2nd Addl. Civil Judge (Jr.Divn) Mysore since, the 1st Defendant illegally sold one of the properties under an attachment to one Rehman Khan and Reshma Bhanu of Mysore.",FAC
"The said suit, after transfer on the ground of jurisdiction is pending on the file of Hon'ble Principal Civil Judge (Sr.Divn), Mysore, in O.S.No.539/2003.",FAC
"O.S.No.
430/2005 is also pending against the 1st Defendant and others in connection with the sale of another item of the attached properties.",FAC
Even after that the 1st Defendant kept on disposing off the properties.,FAC
"
 5. The Plaintiff is a jural authority under the provisions of Income Tax Act and the order of attachment of the Tax Recovery Officer was not challenged before any authority as such the Plaintiff has been in constructive possession of the suit schedule properties.",ANALYSIS
"Further, it was made clear in order of attachment that all persons are prohibited and restrained from transferring or changing the suit schedule properties in any manner.",ANALYSIS
That the suit schedule properties were attached for the recovery of huge arrears of Income Tax dues and Wealth Tax dues from the 3rd Defendant.,ANALYSIS
"The 1st Defendant, without any legal right or title established over the schedule properties, sold the B schedule properties to various purchasers through his General Power of Attorney Holder i.e. 2nd Defendant.",ANALYSIS
It is learnt that 3rd Defendant also sold some of the attached properties.,ANALYSIS
The 1st Defendant by suppressing the said fact is attempting to sell 'A' schedule properties.,ANALYSIS
The order of attachment dated 13.9.1988 and 03.5.1995 are binding on the 1st Defendant also.,ANALYSIS
Hence this suit and the application.,ANALYSIS
"Under these circumstances, if an order to Temporary Injunction as prayed for in I.A. is not granted, the Plaintiff will be put to great loss and the 1st Defendant will sell the remaining properties.",ANALYSIS
In such circumstances it will leads to multiplicity of proceedings.,ANALYSIS
"6. The 1st Defendant, in his written statement has contended that the suit itself is not maintainable either in law or on facts or on preponderance of probabilities.",ANALYSIS
The Tax Recovery Officer has not obtained sanction as required under the Law to file this suit.,ANALYSIS
The Tax Recovery Officer has no locus standi to lodge the suit.,ANALYSIS
The Plaintiff has not complied the provision of C.P.C.,ANALYSIS
Hence the Plaint is liable to be rejected.,ANALYSIS
"Knowing fully well that no Court has declared the 3rd Defendant as the absolute owner of the suit schedule properties, the Plaintiff has falsely contended that the 3rd Defendant is the owner of the suit schedule properties.",ANALYSIS
The Plaintiff's authority has no jurisdiction to decide the title of the suit schedule properties.,ANALYSIS
When it is clear from the further contentions of Paragraph 3 that deceased Mahant would not substantiate that the property belonged to the 3rd Defendant.,ANALYSIS
It is obvious that the property falls under the category of individual property and hence the statement made that it belongs to 3rd Defendant is false.,ANALYSIS
The 1st Defendant as a owner which official record point out and also the revenue records pointed out that properties were ancestral in nature lodged his application for to be treated as Legal representative of the deceased Assessee and tax could be collected from this Defendant.,ANALYSIS
But the Plaintiff was reluctant at the behest of the one Krishna Mohanananda Giri Goswamy.,ANALYSIS
"Despite Court order the Plaintiff contrarily, unilaterally started dealing with a non-existing person.",ANALYSIS
The artificial juridical person styled as 3rd Defendant is not creation of any statute or by any constitution.,ANALYSIS
There is no official record to show the existence of Tripura Bhyravi Matha.,ANALYSIS
The arrears if any has to be claimed from him.,ANALYSIS
Now the revenue is estopped from demanding any such arrears from the 1st Defendant as barred by time.,ANALYSIS
"It is further contended that as by verdicts of Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka and Hon'ble Supreme Court, Bhishma Pithamaha has been held as the absolute owner of certain items of the property.",ANALYSIS
Naturally the Plaintiff ought to have approached this Defendant.,ANALYSIS
But the Plaintiff went on appeasing the self styled Mahant of a non-existing Matha.,ANALYSIS
The contentions made in Paragraph No.5 are totally false.,ANALYSIS
Further contention that the 3rd Defendant was restrained from alienating the property is also false.,ANALYSIS
The Plaintiff has not placed any documents to show that the property stood in the name of 3rd Defendant.,ANALYSIS
The contention made in para 6 of the plaint that it has even by 1995 did not accept this Defendant as at lest prospective Assessee but considered the 3rd Defendant only as the Assessee and dares to state that schedule properties belonging to 3rd Defendant.,ANALYSIS
The Plaintiff knowing fully well that there is a rival claim how did the revenue deal only with the 3rd Defendant.,ANALYSIS
This Defendant is not a party to such order who is in reality has been owner of the schedule properties at relevant point of time.,ANALYSIS
The procedure of attachment cannot be considered as this Defendant was kept away by colluding with the self styled Mahant of non-existing 3rd Defendant.,ANALYSIS
The Plaintiff has no business to say that the properties of 3rd Defendant are sold by this Defendant.,ANALYSIS
No document is placed to show that the 3rd Defendant ever existed.,ANALYSIS
The Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in Writ Petition No.13170 of 1999 has made it clear that the Plaintiff cannot decide as to the ownership of the property.,ANALYSIS
The deceased had even given statement that the alleged Mahantha is his personal and that he is the absolute owner of it.,ANALYSIS
"
 7. It is further contended that the averments made in para 8 are reckless statement.",ANALYSIS
The plaint in O.S.No.932/2002 was returned.,ANALYSIS
Even now in its existing condition the suit is bad for non-payment of sufficient Court fee.,ANALYSIS
The officer of the Plaintiff has made a false statement under oath that the suit is transferred.,ANALYSIS
The Plaintiff has failed to get any order and this Defendant has absolute owner was at liberty to deal with his property in the manner he decide.,ANALYSIS
The Plaintiff lacks elementary principles of law as to what constitutes judicial authority and force of judicial authority.,ANALYSIS
Thus the contentions of para 10 are baseless.,ANALYSIS
The 2nd Defendant has obeyed the 1st Defendant.,ANALYSIS
Thus he is neither a necessary party nor a proper party and no relief is also sought against him.,ANALYSIS
"The Plaintiff is not the authority to state that this Defendant did not have any right, title or interest over the suit schedule properties.",ANALYSIS
"The Plaintiff has filed this false and frivolous suit on the instigation of the 3rd Defendant, when the 3rd Defendant has failed to get any order in any Court of Law.",ANALYSIS
This suit is hopelessly barred by time.,ANALYSIS
"The cause of action dated 17.8.2001, 10.12.2003 and 4.4.2005 relates to 'B' schedule property with respect to which no relief is sought.",ANALYSIS
The deceased Mahant behind 1st Defendant as sole surviving coparcener and since then this Defendant tried to lodge his returns but was not allowed by Revenue.,ANALYSIS
Now that the Civil Courts have held that 1st Defendant is the Legal representative of the deceased Mahant.,ANALYSIS
The Income Tax and Wealth Tax has been remitted indicating clearly the properties that include the suit schedule property.,ANALYSIS
Now the Plaintiff is estopped from stating that the property is that of not 1st Defendant.,ANALYSIS
When the returns are filed and finalized there is no meaning of even mentioning about protective assessment.,ANALYSIS
The department in deed did not accept the contention to AJP.,ANALYSIS
Now the Plaintiff to satisfy the 3rd Defendant has almost accepted this contention.,ANALYSIS
The order of attachment has lost its value in every term when the property is attached for an AJP Assessee but actually it belongs to individual.,ANALYSIS
Thus an order of attachment when carefully perused points out that this Defendant is not the party in those proceedings and the property never belonged to 3rd Defendant.,ANALYSIS
Hence the Income Tax dues is against an individual and not on property.,ANALYSIS
This concept appears to have last sight by the 3rd Defendant as well as the Plaintiff.,ANALYSIS
"
 The Plaintiff has recovered more than 99% of outstanding from the 3rd Defendant from the money amassed by the 3rd Defendant by wrongful sale of 1st Defendant's property at Pune.",ANALYSIS
But this fact has been suppressed by the Plaintiffs.,ANALYSIS
"
 The Plaintiffs have inherited thoughts of multiplying proceedings, as law is merciful in admitting the plaint.",ANALYSIS
The municipal records has classic entries that the property in question in ancestral.,ANALYSIS
"Once it is ancestral, naturally it devolves on the Legal representative.",ANALYSIS
The 1st Defendant is the sole surviving coparcener who succeeds to the estate left behind by the deceased Mahant.,ANALYSIS
The Plaintiff has no right to question this succession.,ANALYSIS
"Under these circumstances, he has sold the properties and subsequently after construction such purchasers have resold the same to various purchasers.",ANALYSIS
No relief thus can be sought against him unless the Plaintiff succeeds to annual the sale deeds.,ANALYSIS
There is no serious question of law or fact that this Court needs to be adjudicated.,ANALYSIS
Hence the plaint is liable to be rejected.,ANALYSIS
"
 8. The 3rd Defendant has not objected for grant the Temporary Injunction as prayed for by the Plaintiff.",ANALYSIS
"9. Both the parties have pleaded the usual pleadings of prima-facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable injury.",ANALYSIS
"On the basis of this contention, the Trial Court has framed Point No. 1 to 4 and answered Point No. 1 in the negative, Point No. 2 in favour of the 1st Defendant, Point No.
3 in the negative and finally dismiss the I.A. filed under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 of C.P.C.
 10.",ANALYSIS
"Aggrieved by the said order of dismissal, the Appellant prefer this appeal on following grounds: 1. The Learned Judge highly erred in dismissing the I.A. 1 he ought to have allowed the I.A. 1 filed by the Appellant.",ARG_PETITIONER
"2. The Learned Judge ought to have noticed the entire contention urged by the Plaintiff/Appellant in the plaint along with the documents especially the returns and the order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Bangalore.",ARG_PETITIONER
"In this behalf, the Learned Judge ought to have noted while disposing I.A. 1 for grant of injunction, the fact of the declaration of the Assessee in respect of the `properties in the returns' as that of the 3rd respondent, the documents produced by the 3rd respondent disclosing that by suppressing material facts before the City Corporation and MUDA the 1st Respondent illegally had obtained the change of khata and R.T.C. entries of the properties to his name, 3.",ARG_PETITIONER
It was highly erroneous on the part of the lower Court that it gave undue importance to the order produced by the 1st Respondent that the Competent Civil Court rejected the application of the 3rd respondent against the 1st Respondent praying to restrain the 1st Respondent from alienating the suit schedule properties while disposing of the I.A. 1.,ARG_PETITIONER
Without going through the said decision the lower Court wrongly relied on it.,ARG_PETITIONER
"
 4. When the Lower Court found out that there is a dispute between the 1st Respondent and the 3rd respondent in respect of the title of the suit schedule properties and Original Suit No.147/95 is pending before the Hon'ble II Addl.Civil Judge (Sr.Div), Mysore between those two Respondents.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
    Such being the case, the lower Court erred and wrongly relied on the Corporation entries and R.T.C. extracts produced by the 1st Respondent while deciding the point of prima-facie case.",ARG_PETITIONER
"5. The Learned Judge highly erred in coming to the conclusion that (i) the Plaintiff did not recognize the 1st Respondent as an Assessee as the Legal representatives of the deceased Mahant P.Krishnandagiri Goswamy to collect the Income Tax dues, (ii) the appellant has not properly applied its mind and taken any steps to recover the Income Tax dues.",ARG_PETITIONER
"It simply brushed aside the documents produced by the 3rd respondent, which disclose that some of the Hon'ble courts recognized the 3rd respondent as the Legal representative of the deceased Mahant P.Krishnandagiri Goswamy and the order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal that the deceased Assessee was holding the suit schedule property only in a representative capacity of and blindly relied on the documents produced by the 1st Respondent.",ARG_PETITIONER
"6. The Lower Court erred in not noticing that since the 1st Respondent did not challenge the findings of the I.T.A.T. Bangalore before the Apex Court or any declaration from the Civil Court that he is the owner of the properties, the Plaintiff cannot recognize him as an Assessee as such his returns were not considered.",ARG_PETITIONER
7. It was erroneous observation made by the lower Court to the effect that the Appellant did not establish a prima-facie case or irreparable loss and injury.,ARG_PETITIONER
It conveniently forgot that by the attempt attributable to the Defendant in alienating the suit `A' schedule properties grave injury would be occasioned to the interest of the Appellant.,ARG_PETITIONER
8. The Learned Judge highly erred in coming to the conclusion that when the Appellant attached the properties it should have taken steps to sell the properties to recover the amount within the time limit shown under of Rule 68B of the IT Rules.,ARG_PETITIONER
"
    The learned lower Court failed to appreciate the fact of pendency of number of I.T. reference cases and appeals before the Higher Courts, which temporarily prevented the authorities from bringing the properties to the process of sale.",ARG_PETITIONER
9. The Learned Lower Court Judge observed that admittedly the 1st Respondent is not a defaulter by which the question of restraining the 1st Respondent from alienating the properties does not arise at all.,ARG_PETITIONER
"It has failed to appreciate the fact that suit properties are charged for Income Tax dues and without clearing the dues/or notice to the department the 1st Respondent got the khata and such other municipal records changed to his name, which gave rise to the Appellant to enforce the cause of action.
 10.",ARG_PETITIONER
It was highly erroneously observation made by the lower Court to the effect that there was no necessity to file a suit for permanent injunction instead of that the Appellant could have taken action to sell the attached properties and make the 1st Respondent approach the Court of Law.,ARG_PETITIONER
"
    It conveniently forgot that the relief of permanent injunction was the only suitable relief that could be claimed.",ARG_PETITIONER
"11. The Learned Lower Court Judge failed to notice that the order of attachment dated 13.9.1988 was duly served on the deceased Mahant P.Krishnandagiri Goswamy on 14.9.1988, when the lower Court finds that with regard to the legal heirship of the properties is under dispute and it is shown that the 1st Respondent already sold the B schedule properties to various purchasers, an order of injunction ought to have been granted in the case of the Appellant to safeguard the revenue of the State.",ARG_PETITIONER
12. It was highly erroneous observation made by the lower Court that in view of the case law furnished by the 1st Defendant (ILR 1997 Kar 3089) the relief of permanent injunction cannot be granted.,ARG_PETITIONER
It erred in not noting that the said case law is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case of the appellant.,ARG_PETITIONER
The reasoning given by the lower Court in support of its order of dismissal is neither cogent nor correct.,ARG_PETITIONER

 13. It was erroneous observation made by the Lower Court to the effect that the Appellant did not establish a prima-facie, therefore the question of considering balance of convenience and irreparable injury does not arise.",ARG_PETITIONER

Point No: 1 to 4: All these points are interrelated and hence answering in common in order to avoid the repetition of facts.,ANALYSIS
"
 15. From the contention taken by the Plaintiff and the Defendants in the present case it is clear that, 1st Defendant is claiming the suit schedule properties under succession and Defendant No.3 is claiming the suit schedule properties as acquired as he is represents the 3rd Defendant.",ANALYSIS
"With respect to the suit schedule properties, there is a title dispute between the 1st Defendant and the 3rd Defendant.",ANALYSIS
"
Admittedly, the 1st Defendant has filed a suit against the 3rd Defendant in O.S.No.147/1995 and 3rd Defendant has filed a suit against the 1st Defendant in O.S.No. 100/1994 and 258/1998.",ANALYSIS
"
 16. The Appellant has produced the certified copy of the Judgement and Decree passed in O.S.No.147/1995, 100/1994 and 258/1998 wherein the common Judgement was passed and the suit filed by the 1st Defendant in O.S.No.
147/1995 was dismissed and O.S.No.100/1994 and 258/1998 was decreed.",ANALYSIS

"The said appeals have been dismissed with penal costs of Rs.10,000/- each and confirmed the order of the Trial Court.",ANALYSIS
"
 17. The Respondent No.1 along with his written argument has produced certified copy of the Order sheet of the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in R.S.A.No.984/2010 wherein the execution of the Decree is stayed till next date of hearing.",ANALYSIS
No further orders have been produced by the Appellant or the Respondents with respect to R.S.A.No.984/2010 pending before the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka.,ANALYSIS
"Thus, as on the date of filing the suit, the title dispute with respect to the suit schedule properties between 1st Defendant and 3rd Defendant was not concluded.",ANALYSIS
"The Trial Court has considered all the documentary evidence produced by both the parties and also considered the pleadings of the both the parties and since O.S.No.147/1995, 100/1994 and 258/1998 were pending.",ANALYSIS
"When the suit is filed only for the relief of permanent injunction restraining the 3rd Defendant Mahant P.Krishnandagiri Goswamy for transferring or changing the attached property, in any way and that all persons were prohibited from enjoying any benefit under such transfer until further order of the Tax recovery officer, Mysore Circle.
 The Plaintiff has not recognizing the 1st Defendant is an Assessee with respect to the suit schedule properties and tax dues to the Plaintiff.",ANALYSIS
As on the date of filing the suit as admitted by the Plaintiff himself that the suit schedule properties are standing in the name of 1st Defendant and not in the name of the 3rd Defendant.,ANALYSIS
"Admittedly, with respect to the tax dues to the Plaintiff, there is a proceeding before the Competent Authority.",ANALYSIS
The said Competent Authority cannot decide the title of the parties with respect to the suit schedule properties.,ANALYSIS
The title dispute between the 1st Defendant and 3rd Defendant with respect to the suit schedule properties is still pending before the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka.,ANALYSIS
Defendants No.1 and 3 are fighting for declaration of title between themselves with respect to the suit schedule properties.,ANALYSIS
"When the Competent Authority has ordered to attach the properties, then it should have taken steps to sell the properties to recover the amount as contemplated U/s.
 68(b) of Income Tax Act.",ANALYSIS
"But there is no steps are taken within the period of limitation, which has not been explained by the Plaintiff in the present case.",ANALYSIS
"The Trial Court relying on a decision reported in ILR 1997 Kar 3089 wherein it is held that ""Suit against alienation is not maintainable and if such injunction is granted it will be against the very toner, tone and ambit of the Transfer of Property Act"".",ANALYSIS
"In the present case the Plaintiff has sought for a declaration order of attachment dated 3.5.1995 issued by Tax Recovery Officer, Range II, Mysore, in respect of the suit schedule properties is absolute and binding the Defendants.",ANALYSIS
The Plaintiff need not seek such a relief because any order passed under the Income Tax Act is binding on the parties.,ANALYSIS
Hence if this relief is excludes then relief of permanent injunction is an only remains.,ANALYSIS
But as per the above said decision the relief of permanent injunction cannot be granted.,ANALYSIS
No relief is sought in respect of 'B' schedule properties in the present case.,ANALYSIS
"Considering all these facts the Trial Court has answered Point No. 1 in negative.
 18.",ANALYSIS
"As already stated above, title dispute between the 1st Defendant and the 3rd Defendant is still pending before the Competent Court of Law and the said suits were disposed off by the original Court and first appeal is also dismissed.",ANALYSIS
Now the matter is pending before the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka.,ANALYSIS
"In view of the fact that when the Plaintiff is not considering the 1st Defendant is an Assessee for the alleged dues to the Plaintiff with respect to the Income Tax and Wealth Tax as contended by the Plaintiff and the properties were standing in the name of the 1st Defendant as on the date of filing the present suit and Defendant No.3 is also claiming that he is owner of the suit schedule properties, under these circumstances, the Defendants cannot alienate the suit schedule properties since the Plaintiff is having claim over the suit schedule properties with respect to the tax dues.",ANALYSIS
"
 19. After disposal off of O.S.No. 147/1995, 100/1994 and 258/1998, Plaintiff who has filed O.S.No. 430/2005 against the Defendants on the file of this Court was withdrawn by the Plaintiff on the ground that, since the suit filed by the 1st Defendant against the 3rd Defendant in O.S.No.147/1995 was dismissed with cost.",ANALYSIS
The suit in O.S.No.100/1994 and 258/1998 filed by the 3rd Defendant against the Defendant No.1 are decreed with cost and 3rd Defendant Mahant K.Krishna Mohanananda Giri Goswamy is declared as the owner of the suit schedule property.,ANALYSIS
"In the mean while, 3rd Defendant has acquired the major portion tax and interest portion of tax also left with him.",ANALYSIS
"His waiver petition is pending before Chief Commissioner, Bangaluru and on that ground it is not usual purpose will be served when continued the said suit when the said suit was allowed to be withdrawn to proceed against the 3rd Defendant if necessary.",ANALYSIS
The claim of the Plaintiff in that suit and the claim of the Plaintiff in the present suit are almost similar.,ANALYSIS
The Trial Court has considered all the documentary evidence and the relevant provisions of Income Tax and held that the suit itself is not maintainable in view of the decision reported in ILR 1997 Kar 3089.,ANALYSIS
"At this stage, I am of the considered view that the maintainability of suit cannot be consider at this stage and same has to be considered only at the time of final hearing of the suit.",RATIO
The only point that has to be decided in disposing off the application whether the Plaintiff has got prima-facie case or not?,RATIO
The Defendants are not denying the dues to the Plaintiff towards the Income Tax and Wealth Tax.,RATIO
"Under these circumstances, I am of the view that the order of the Trial Court is requires to be modified though on the basis of the pleadings, Plaintiff is not entitled to claim the relief sought in the present suit as discussed by Trial Court.",RATIO
"Since it is a pre-trial stage, I am of the view that Plaintiff has got prima-facie case at this stage and balance of convenience is also lies in his favour and if the properties are disposed off either by the 1st Defendant or by the 3rd Defendant then the Plaintiff cannot recover the huge sum of money dues with respect to the Income Tax and Wealth Tax as claimed by the Plaintiff in the present suit.",RATIO
"Hence, I am of the view that the Defendants are directed to maintain STATUS QUO of the suit schedule properties till final disposal of title dispute between the 1st Defendant and the 3rd Defendant with respect to the suit schedule properties.",RATIO
"The Plaintiff at this stage cannot claim that he is entitled for the relief claimed in I.A. when pending dispute between the 1st Defendant and 3rd Defendant, I am of the view that the Trial Court order has to be modified accordingly.",RATIO

"It may be added here that during the inquest proceedings on 29.05.2012, the SDM had also examined Ram Preet (PW8), his statement (Ex.PW8/B), however, being non-committal inasmuch as he only pointed out some injury marks on the neck of Rajni, he being not clear as to how she may have died.

".      Be that as it may, the investigation could not bring out any evidence to support the allegations of it being a case of culpable homicide, the autopsy report (particularly the final opinion given by the autopsy doctor), and the circumstances in which the dead body had been discovered, as reflected, inter alia, by the evidence of at least two neighbours – Nihal Devi (PW-6) and Kamlesh (PW-11)",FAC
"– leaving no room for doubt that Rajni had committed suicide by hanging herself by the neck, it leading to asphyxia.",FAC
"
 7.      While the inquiry was pending before the SDM, Lado Devi (PW-4) mother of Rajni (hereinafter, the deceased) made a complaint to various authorities on 18.06.2012, the addressees including, amongst       others,    the        Commissioner   of   Police,   the    Deputy Commissioner of Police of the area and the Station House Officer (SHO) of the police station.",FAC
"In the said complaint, she reiterated her suspicion that her daughter had been killed narrating in that context certain events which showed that Rajni had been subjected to cruelty for dowry in the matrimonial home by the husband and some of the relatives.",FAC
"Against the said backdrop, on 06.08.2012, the SDM issued a directive (Ex.PW10/G) to the SHO of Police Station Kotla Mubarakpur calling him upon to “take necessary action as per law in the matter of Rajni” referring in this context to DD No.45-A, dated 28.05.2012.",FAC
"In the entire proceedings, as indeed in the statement of the SDM (PW-10), there is no clarity as to what had prompted the SDM to “recommend” the registration of the FIR against the backdrop of the statements which had been recorded by him after examining Jagdish Kohli (PW-9), Sangeeta (PW-1) and Ram Preet (PW-8).",FAC
"
 8.      Be that as it may, upon receipt of the aforementioned directions of the SDM, and in express compliance thereof, the investigating officer (PW-20) to whom the said order had been made over by the SHO, recorded an endorsement (Ex.PW-20/A) in continuation of the statement (Ex.PW9/F) of Jagdish Koli (PW-9) seeking from the duty officer registration of first information report (FIR) for offences under sections 498A/304-B and 34 IPC, and pursuant to the said endorsement, the duty officer ASI Raj Kumar (PW-16) registered the FIR (Ex.PW16/A) at 10:30 p.m. on 06.08.2012, more than two months after the event of unnatural death.
 9.      During the course of the investigation by SI Vishal Choudhary (PW-20) amongst others steps, he recorded the statements of Jagdish Koli (PW-9), his wife Sangeeta (PW1), his mother Lado Devi (PW-4), his sister Seema (PW-2) and Kamlesh (PW-3), besides those of other relevant witnesses.",FAC
"Based primarily on the said evidence, and some confirmation from the call detail records (CDR) of at least three mobile telephone numbers which had statedly been in use of the individuals involved, a report (charge sheet) under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr.P.C.) was submitted on 23.11.2012 in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate (MM) seeking trial for offences under Sections 498-A/304-B/201/34 IPC.
 10.     Upon cognizance being taken by the concerned Metropolitan Magistrate, it leading to issuance of process, four persons came to be put on trial they including Fateh Singh (A1), Daya Ram (A2), Puran Lal (A3) and Rajkumari @ Natho Devi (A4), the charges framed against them on 07.11.2013 being primarily for offences under Sections 498-A and Section 304-B IPC read with Section 34 IPC.",FAC
The trial court also framed an alternative charge under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC.,FAC
"
 11.     The prosecution led evidence by examining twenty-five witnesses, they including Sangeeta (PW-1), sister-in-law of Rajni (deceased); Seema (PW-2), younger sister of the deceased; Kamlesh (PW-3), elder sister of the deceased; Lado Devi (PW-4), mother of the deceased; Constable Jagdish (PW-5), who had gone to the house of the accused and arrested him vide memo (Ex PW-5/A); Nihal Devi (PW- 6), neighbour of the deceased; Constable Rajeev Kumar (PW-7), who had gone to the mortuary of AIIMS for the post mortem examination on the dead body of the deceased; Rampreet (PW-8), sister-in-law of the deceased; Jagdish Koli (PW-9), brother of the deceased; Dr. R.K.
Aggarwal (PW-10), Superintendent of Department Training and Technical Education; Kamlesh (PW-11), neighbour of the deceased; Constable Ankit (PW-12), who had taken the dead body to the mortuary of AIIMS and seized certain articles; Israr Babu (PW-13), Alternate Nodal Officer of Vodafone Mobile Services; Constable Satyapal Sharma (PW-14), who had collected sealed envelope along with the sample seal and taken the same to FSL, Rohini; Inspector Naresh Kumar (PW-15), who had inspected the spot and prepared report in such regard (Ex.P/W-15/A); ASI Raj Kumar (PW-16), who had registered the FIR No.168/12; Head Constable Kapil (PW-17), who had gone to the place of incident and taken the photographs; Sarvesh Kumar (PW-18), Nodal Officer of Idea Cellular Ltd.; Constable Kavita (PW-19), who recorded the statement of some of the witnesses; SI Vishal Choudhary (PW-20), the investigating officer (IO); Dr. Shashank Pooniya (PW-21), Ex-senior resident of AIIMS Hospital, who had conducted the post-mortem examination on the dead body of the deceased; Retired S.I.

12.     ,FAC
The evidence led by the prosecution was put to the accused persons (now appellants before this court).,FAC
"While admitting the evidence about the marriage of Rajni with Fateh Singh (A-1) on 03.12.2011, and her unnatural death in the matrimonial home on 28.05.2012, the evidence showing cruelty having been meted out to her in the matrimonial home, particularly, on account of dowry was denied and disputed.",FAC
"13.     It may be mentioned here that Daya Ram (A-2) is cousin brother of Raj Kumari (A-4) and, therefore, is treated by Fateh Singh (A-1) as maternal uncle (mama) and consequently, he has been referred to as mama-sasur in relation to the deceased Rajni.",FAC
Certain role in the context of alleged cruelty for dowry is attributed to him by some of witnesses.,FAC
"
 14.     After the statements under Section 313 Cr.PC. had been recorded, the accused persons were called upon to adduce evidence in defence.",FAC
"Geeta (DW1), a relative of the appellants was examined primarily to bring on record the circumstances in which the fact of Rajni having committed suicide was discovered.",FAC
"Daya Ram (A-2) entered the witness box (as DW2), also supporting the word of DW1 in above regard, he claiming to have been present at the scene on account of a social visit.",FAC
"
 15.     The learned Additional Session Judge considered the evidence brought on record and, by his judgment dated 17.12.2018, concluded that the alternative charge under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC had not been brought home, his findings indicating acceptance of the theory that Rajni had committed suicide.",RLC
"The trial court accepted the evidence of prosecution witnesses, particularly Jagdish Koli (PW-9), Sangeeta (PW-1), Seema (PW-2), Kamlesh (PW-3) and Lado Devi (PW-4) as to cruelty for dowry having been meted out to Rajni in the matrimonial home, soon before her death and in unnatural circumstances.",RLC

"By order dated 19.12.2018, the trial court awarded simple imprisonment for three years with fine of Rs.50,000/- each for offence under Section 498-A read with section 34 IPC, and simple imprisonment for ten years for offence under Section 304-B read with Section 34 IPC.",RLC
"It was directed that both the sentences would run concurrently, the benefit of set off under Section 428 Cr.P.C. having been accorded.",RLC
"
 17.     The arguments on the appeals have been heard at length and the record has been perused with assistance from both sides.",NONE
"
 18.     The charge under Section 302 read with section 34 of IPC had not been pressed by the investigating agency.",FAC
It was framed by the trial court as an alternative charge.,FAC
"The said charge could not be proved, as is shown by the finding returned by the trial court.",ANALYSIS
The State has not challenged the judgment of the trial court to that extent by any appeal or petition.,ANALYSIS
"The findings to that extent have attained finality and, thus, the accusations to such effect will have to be kept aside; all the more so because on the basis of available evidence, such charge cannot succeed, it being clear from the evidence on both sides that the room where Rajni was found hanging by the neck, she apparently having died before her body was shifted to AIIMS, was closed from inside, there being no credence to the suspicion that she may have been killed, the injury mark on the neck to which some reference was made by the members of parental family being the mark caused by the ligature, as is substantiated by photographs of the dead body which were brought on record.",ANALYSIS
"Thus, the other evidence requires to be re-appreciated, while accepting the conclusion of the trial court that Rajni had indeed committed suicide.",ANALYSIS
"
 19.     The marriage of Rajni with Fateh Singh (A-1) had taken place on 03.12.2011.",ANALYSIS
It is indeed shocking that she was constrained to commit suicide in the matrimonial home on 28.05.2012.,ANALYSIS
"But, it is the reasons that may have impelled her to commit suicide which would be crucial.",ANALYSIS
"In these circumstances, the court has to examine, particularly on account of charge under Section 304-B IPC, to find out as to whether there is any evidence available to show that soon before her death she had been subjected by the husband or members of the matrimonial family, to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any demand for dowry.",ANALYSIS
"The trial court has answered the said query in the affirmative and on the basis of such conclusion has applied the presumption under Section 113-B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 to hold the appellants guilty of the charge under Section 304-B IPC, the accusations relevant to the charge under Section 498-A IPC being inherent in the gravamen of the charge for the former offence.",ANALYSIS
"
 20.     From the above perspective, the case hangs in balance on the testimonies of Jagdish Koli (PW-9), Sangeeta (PW-1), Seema (PW-2), Kamlesh (PW-3), Lado Devi (PW-4) and Ram Preet (PW-8).",ANALYSIS
The evidence of the said witnesses has been subjected to acute scrutiny by this court.,ANALYSIS
It will be appropriate to deal with them seriatim.,ANALYSIS
"
 21.     It is clear from the evidence that her father having died earlier, the mother (PW-4) being a widowed illiterate lady, the responsibility of settling Rajni in marriage had fallen upon her brother Jagdish Koli (PW-9).",ANALYSIS
"He is on record to state that it is he who had arranged the marriage with great pomp and show, having spent sufficient amount of money.",ANALYSIS
"Undoubtedly, the mother (PW-4) would have also chipped in for finances, she obviously having been party to the arrangements throughout.",ANALYSIS
"
 22.     The evidence of the above mentioned witnesses of the parental family of the deceased clearly demonstrates that they hail from Rajasthan where the widowed mother of the deceased had certain landed property for sale of which she appeared to have been away around the time when the unfortunate event took place.",ANALYSIS
"Be that as it may, they appear to be a close-knit family, who would be thick with each other, assisting and supporting those in distress.",ANALYSIS
"One of the sisters who were living with Jagdish Koli (PW-9) under the same roof include Kamlesh (PW-3), who is stated to be a divorcee.",ANALYSIS
"There is evidence brought on record showing a telephonic contact made by the deceased on 26.05.2012 with her sisters (PW-2) and (PW-3) who, pursuant to her entreaties, had met her in a temple on 27.05.2012.",ANALYSIS
"
Noticeably, PW-2 and PW-3 would speak about said meeting though also confirming that Rajni had been accompanied at that point of time by her husband Fateh Singh (A-1).
 23.     The prosecution evidence brought out through mouthpiece of Jagdish Koli (PW-9) and Sangeeta (PW-1) reveals that on 28.05.2012, the deceased had called the latter on her phone at about 3-4 p.m.
informing her about ill treatment at the hands of the mother-in-law (A- 4).",ANALYSIS
It is stated that Rajni sounded to be in distress and wanted the parental family to assist her or else she would be constrained to leave the matrimonial home.,ANALYSIS
The evidence shows that PW-1 had tried to soothe her with some assurances and then informed her husband (PW- 9).,ANALYSIS
"After some time, at about 4–5 p.m., Fateh Singh (A-1) had called Sangeeta (PW-1) on her mobile phone telling her that Rajni was in serious condition and was being shifted to Safdarjung hospital.",ANALYSIS
"It is stated that after some time, A-1 again rang up to inform PW-9 that Rajni had died.",ANALYSIS
"It is against this backdrop that PW-9 accompanied by his wife PW-1, and followed by his brother-in-law (PW-8), had reached the matrimonial home of Rajni finding her dead body lying there with the injury mark on the neck, which had given reason to their suspicion that she had been killed.",ANALYSIS
"
 24.     When the aforementioned three witnesses were examined by the SDM on 29.05.2012, there was no allegation of any history of ill treatment to Rajni on account of demands of dowry.                 ",ANALYSIS
"Though Rampreet (PW-8) was totally silent on this issue, his statement (Ex.PW-8/B) not even indicating any questioning on this score, he nonetheless expressly stated that Rajni was living after marriage with her husband happily, (“शादी के बाद रजनी अपने पति फ़िेह स हिं के ाथ ख़श ु ी े रह रही थी”).",ANALYSIS
"Jagdish Koli (PW-9) and Sangeeta (PW-1), in contrast, by their respective statements (Ex.PW-9/F and Ex.PW-1/D1) before SDM had totally ruled out any harassment on account of dowry demands.",ANALYSIS
"PW-9 stated that neither Fateh Singh (A-1) nor any members of his family had ever made any demand of dowry from him or any members of his family (“मेरे दामाद फ़िेह स हिं िथा उ के पररवार वाऱो ने मझ ु े िथा मेरे पररवार के कक ी भी     दस्य   े कभी दहे ज़ की कोई मािंग नहीिं की”),",ANALYSIS
similar statement,ANALYSIS
"being made by PW-1, (“मेरे नन्दोई फ़िेह स हिं िथा उ के पररवार वाऱो ने हम े कभी कोई दहे ज़ की मािंग नहीिं की”).
 25.     In their respective statements before the SDM, PW-9 and PW-1, however, spoke about there having been two or three other occasions wherein Rajni (the deceased) had had quarrels with her husband (A-1).",ANALYSIS
"
PW-9 informed the SDM, and PW-1 confirmed her husband in such regard, that upon information being given about the quarrels by his sister (the deceased), he had gone to meet her in the matrimonial home but she was unable to say anything to him.",ANALYSIS
"(“ऱेककन जब मैं उ के पा जािा था िो वह कुछ कह नहीिं पािी थी ”).
 26.     PW-9 and PW-1 narrated the sequence of events of 28.05.2012, wherein the first telephonic call had come from the deceased on the mobile phone of PW-1 at about 3/4 p.m. wherein she had informed that A-1 was harassing her by taunts (“उ की       ा   (नत्थो दे वी) उ े िाने मार रही है ”) and that she was threatening to leave the matrimonial home.
 ",ANALYSIS
"This was followed by the telephonic call at about 4/5 p.m. from A-1, initially indicating that Rajni was unwell but later confirming she to have died.",ANALYSIS
"It is obvious that though the suicidal death by hanging had come to the notice to the matrimonial family, they were unable to communicate immediately with the parental family.",ANALYSIS
"            It may be mentioned here itself, that in the said three statements before the SDM, there was no reference made to telephonic or other contact between Rajni and the parental family on the preceding two dates, particularly the telephonic call to PW-2 on 26.05.2012, pursuant to which Rajni, on one hand, and PW-2 and PW-3, on the other had met each other in a temple on 27.05.2012.
 ",ANALYSIS
"27.     As mentioned above, the inquiry remained pending with the SDM till 06.08.2012 without any meaningful action.",ANALYSIS
"In the three statements before the SDM, there was no allegation of any harassment of the deceased woman for dowry.",ANALYSIS
"Though it was indicated that the parental family had suspicion about the death being homicidal, there was no confirmation inasmuch as the autopsy opinion was still awaited.",ANALYSIS
"As also noticed earlier, the suspicion about the death being homicidal was unfounded, the accusations in that regard having eventually failed.",ANALYSIS
"
 28.     The events, however, took a turn in the wake of the complaint dated 18.06.2012 made by PW-4 (Lado Devi) to the various authorities, such complaint reaching, as per the endorsement, the SHO of the police station only on 26.06.2012.             ",ANALYSIS
The complaint dated 18.06.2012 runs into four type written pages.,ANALYSIS
It has not been introduced in the evidence formally by the prosecution nor was it used by the defence for any purposes at the trial.,ANALYSIS
"Be that as it may, the same available (at pages 743-749) on the trial court record has been perused.",ANALYSIS
"
The prime thrust of the allegations therein was to bring the suspicion about murder to the notice of the police authorities to seek action under the law.",ANALYSIS
"         Nonetheless, accusations were also made about harassment for dowry.",ANALYSIS
"              It is against this backdrop, that after registration of the FIR on 06.8.2012, the investigating officer (PW-20) started recording statements under Section 161 Cr.P.C.",ANALYSIS
"He recorded the statement of first informant Jagdish Koli (PW-9) vide Ex.PW- 9/DA and that of his wife Sangeeta (PW-1) vide (Ex.PW-1/D2) both on 28.08.2012.
 29.     ",ANALYSIS
"In the above said statements under Section 161 Cr.P.C., the witnesses made marked improvements over their version of 29.05.2012 before the SDM.",ANALYSIS
"They would now accuse the husband and other members of the family including parents, and mama-sasur, of having subjected Rajni to harassment on account of dowry demand, the demand particularly being about a motor cycle, Daya Ram (A-2) being the person who had instigated others in such regard.",ANALYSIS
The IO had also recorded the supplementary statement of Jagdish Koli (PW-9) on 07.08.2012 (Ex.PW-9/DB) about certain steps in investigation.,ANALYSIS
"
Around the same period, statements under Section 161 Cr.P.C. of PW- 2 (Seema), PW-3 (Kamlesh) and PW-4 (Lado Devi) were recorded, such statements making out eventually a case of dowry death.",ANALYSIS
"
 30.     ",ANALYSIS
"Sangeeta (PW-1) and Jagdish Koli (PW-9) spoke about A-2 (Daya Ram) having raised a quarrel (on the date of marriage itself) over non fulfillment of the demand of motorcycle and dowry, the appellants having been pacified at that point of time with assurances that such demand would be fulfilled in due course.",ANALYSIS
"Similar statements were made by PW-2, PW-3 and PW-4.",ANALYSIS
There was reference made to the events of marriage having been subjected to videography.,ANALYSIS
"
Reference was also made to a DVD of such video footage being made available.",ANALYSIS
"    The investigating officer (PW-20), on his part, during cross-examination, however, confirmed that the DVD footage of the marriage had been seen by him and it did not depict any scene of such quarrel or dispute at the time of marriage.",ANALYSIS
"Though, witnesses of the family of the deceased would speak about such quarrel having been raised in loud voices, it having been witnessed by a large number of persons who were attending the marriage, aside from the immediate members of the family, there is no corroboration from any independent quarter, and this includes PW-6 (Nihal Devi) and PW-11 (Kamlesh), who have been neighbours to the appellants in the same locality.",ANALYSIS
"
 31.     During the course of trial, Sangeeta (PW-1) and Jagdish (PW-9) were confronted with their respective statements before the SDM.",ANALYSIS
"It is difficult to accept the allegation from their mouthpiece that the appellants had subjected Rajni to any harassment on account of illicit demands for dowry, inclusive of expectation of a motorcycle, particularly against the backdrop of their first version before the SDM given at the earliest opportune moment on 29.05.2012.
 32.     ",ANALYSIS
"Thus, the evidence of PW-1 (Sangeeta) and PW-9 (Jagdish Koli) to the extent it relates to the allegations of harassment of Rajni for illicit demands of dowry will have to be kept aside.",ANALYSIS
"The only circumstances which can be picked up safely from such evidence are the history of quarrels between Rajni, on one hand, and her husband A1 (Fateh Singh), on the other, atleast on two or three occasions in the past, each time the brother (PW-9) having gone to assist the sister (the deceased), but she not confiding in him the background facts.",ANALYSIS
"The telephonic call that was made by the deceased to PW-1 in the afternoon of 28.05.2012, a few hours before she committed suicide, does indicate that she was perturbed because the mother-in-law (A4) was subjecting her to taunts.",ANALYSIS
"But, there is nothing in the evidence to reveal as to what was the root cause of the said verbal issue with the mother-in-law.",ANALYSIS
There is nothing indicated that the taunts were of such nature as would instigate a person of mature age to proceed to commit suicide.,ANALYSIS
"
 33.     Thus, the case of the prosecution has to be tested from the view- point of the evidence of PW-2 (Seema), PW-3 (Kamlesh) and PW-4 (Lado Devi).",ANALYSIS
"34.     PW-4, as observed earlier, is an aged widowed lady.",ANALYSIS
"She spoke about visits of the deceased to her house, after marriage, she having confided in her that she was not allowed any food and that the appellants would abuse her, she feeling surrounded and haunted, also having been threatened to be killed.",ANALYSIS
None of the earlier witnesses would speak on these lines.,ANALYSIS
"Since Jagdish Koli (PW-9) is the elder brother who had arranged the marriage, it is difficult to imagine against the conservative family background from which the parties come, that he would not be privy to such grievances of Rajni.",ANALYSIS
"
Noticeably, in his statement before the SDM, he had informed on 29.05.2012 that he was not aware of any cause of grouse felt by Rajni.",ANALYSIS
"
He also did not mention about any visits of Rajni to the parental home during the said period.",ANALYSIS
"
 35.     PW-2 and PW-3 spoke about the telephonic call of 26.05.2012 leading to a meeting by them with Rajni in a temple in Hari Nagar in the morning hours of 27.05.2012.",ANALYSIS
"As mentioned earlier, both the said witnesses confirmed that A-1 (Fateh Singh) had also accompanied Rajni at that point of time though they would refer to their conversation as one in confidence in the privacy of toilets.",ANALYSIS
"As per PW-2, during the said meeting, Rajni had disclosed that A-1, A-4 and sisters-in-law (who were not prosecuted) would beat her up demanding dowry as they were not satisfied with the dowry articles.",ANALYSIS
"
 He stated that Rajni appeared weak and perturbed.",ANALYSIS
She had statedly told that she was having some injury on her back which had been inflicted by A-1 and A-4.,ANALYSIS
"          PW-3 while deposing about the said meeting with Rajni on 27.05.2012 instead spoke about harassment not only by the husband and mother-in-law but also by mama-sasur and both sisters, adding the name of Mohit, the younger brother of the husband, the last attributable to some theft of cash from her almirah, Mohit having rebuked her for having locked the almirah.",ANALYSIS
"
 36.     The evidence of PW-2 and PW-3 about exchange of words with Rajni in the temple in the morning of 27.05.2012 is not on the same lines.",ANALYSIS
"Both spoke differently, though A-1 (Fateh Singh) and A-4 (Raj Kumari) would remain common factors.",ANALYSIS
The reference in their statements to physical beating having resulted in some injury on the back of Rajni is not supported by any other evidence.,ANALYSIS
The learned Additional Public Prosecutor conceded that neither the MLC nor the autopsy report would confirm this aspect.,ANALYSIS
"       The theory of dispute involving Mohit concerning theft of cash from the almirah of Rajni indicates that possibility of grouses other than those arising out of dowry harassment being the root cause cannot be ruled out.
 37.     ",ANALYSIS
"In the above mentioned facts and circumstances, the evidence of PW-2, PW-3 and PW-4 about harassment meted out to the deceased in the matrimonial home is also not found to be credible.",ANALYSIS
Mystery remains as to why Rajni felt constrained to commit suicide within less than six months of her marriage.,ANALYSIS
Some clue in this regard possibly lies in the revelations made by Jagdish Koli (PW-9) that Rajni was not keeping well and she had been under treatment.,ANALYSIS
The investigation unfortunately did not dig out any material as to what kind of ailment Rajni was suffering from and as to whether it could or would have any connection with the possible reasons for her to commit suicide.,RATIO

The brief allegations are that,- On 24.11.1994, on receipt of credible information that some ganja was kept illegally in the house at Vallepur Border Thanda, the Sub-Inspector of Excise, Aurad Sub-Range, along with his staff conducted raid on that house and searched the residential house and found two bags each weighing 20 Kgs., of ganja and totally 50 Kgs. of ganja was recovered.",FAC
"A mahazar was drawn at the spot and thereafter, charge sheet appears to have been filed showing the accused as absconding.",FAC
"
The Court inspite of making all its efforts to secure the presence of the accused, as the Court was not able to locate the whereabouts of the accused, it recorded the evidence under Section 299 of Cr.P.C., and transferred the case to long pending register.",FAC
"Subsequently, it appears, this Court has directed all the Presiding Officers to open the cases which were transferred to Long Pending Register and to give two-three months time to secure the presence of the accused.",FAC
"In that context, it appears, the Trial Court also re-opened the case and issued non-bailable warrant against the accused.",FAC
"
 3. It is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that absolutely there is no material to implicate the accused into the crime and there is no material to show that he was informed about the case registered against him under the NDPS Act.",ARG_PETITIONER
He was not at all aware of such case pending against him.,ARG_PETITIONER
"
Recently, he came to know that police are searching for him in connection with the case, then he approached the Sessions Court for grant of anticipatory bail which came to be rejected.",ARG_PETITIONER
"4. On careful perusal of the entire charge sheet papers, it is clear that the charge sheet does not disclose that the house in which the raid has been conducted by the Excise Department belonged to the petitioner.",ANALYSIS
No witnesses have been examined by the police atleast to prima facie show to the Court that they have raided the house of the petitioner and recovered the said ganja from his house.,ANALYSIS
Even the charge sheet papers do not disclose the house number in which ganja has been seized by the Excise Department.,ANALYSIS
Even they have not made any attempt to obtain necessary documents from the village panchayat or Municipality of that village in order to show that the place where the ganja has been seized actually belonged to this petitioner.,ANALYSIS
"The material does not show that the petitioner is a permanent resident of said village i.e., Vallepur Border Thanda.",ANALYSIS
The police also have not made any efforts to show that the said person is the resident of the said village and he has got any residential premise.,ANALYSIS
The entire charge sheet discloses that the police have seized two gunny bags containing ganja from a house in Vallepure Border Thanda.,ANALYSIS
Except that nothing could be made out from the charge sheet as to how the police are connecting the petitioner into the crime.,ANALYSIS
"
 5. The learned counsel for the petitioner strenuously submitted that petitioner never lived in Vallepur Border Thanda.",ARG_PETITIONER
"He is a permanent resident of Venkatesh Nagar in Lathur District therefore, he was not in a position to know about the pendency of any case registered against him.",ARG_PETITIONER
"In support of this, he has produced a certified copy of the judgment passed in M.A.C.P.No.34/2011 in the Court of Principal District Judge and Ex-Officio Member of MACT at Latur, wherein this petitioner has filed a petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act seeking compensation for the accident met by him.",ARG_PETITIONER
"In the said judgment his address is shown as resident of Venkatesh Nagar, Latur.",ARG_PETITIONER
The said petition came to be partly allowed.,ARG_PETITIONER
"In view of the above circumstances, as there is material to show that this petitioner was having knowledge about the registration of any case against him and he deliberately absconded himself without surrendering himself to the Court or the police, the anticipatory bail could have been accorded in favour of him by the Sessions Court.",ANALYSIS
"
However, the Sessions Court without appreciating the materials on record has simply swayed away by the registration of the case and quantity of ganja seized in the case.",ANALYSIS
"In my opinion, petitioner has made out a ground for anticipatory bail.",ANALYSIS
"
 6. Hence, I pass the following: ORDER The petition is allowed.",RPC
"Consequently, the petitioner shall be released on bail in connection with Spl.C.C.No.28/1995 pending on the file of Principal District and Sessions Judge, Bidar, subject to following conditions: i) The petitioner shall surrender himself before the learned Special Judge within one week from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and shall execute a personal bond for a sum of `50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand Only) with one solvent surety for the likesum to the satisfaction of the learned Special Judge.",RPC
"
 ii) The petitioner shall not indulge in tampering the prosecution witnesses.",RPC
"
 iii) The petitioner shall appear before the Court on all future dates of hearing unless prevented by any genuine cause.",RPC

"

The Prosecution story as per First Information Report is that: One Bijaya Kumar Patra lodged a written report before the Officer in Charge, Koira P.S alleging that on 18.12.2010 at about 6.50 PM about 18 to 20 persons being armed with gun entered into his house and broke the suit cases and boxes.",FAC
They also damaged the furnitures of his house.,FAC

After closure of the investigation the charge sheet is submitted against the above named accused along with 9 others under the aforesaid offences.,FAC
"Accordingly, the cognizance has been taken by the court of SDJM, Bonai and thereafter the case was committed to the court of Additional Sessions Judge, Bonai.",FAC
"

4. The following points are to be determined in this case: I.,ISSUE
"Whether on 18.12.2010 at about 6.50 PM at Ganua, the accused along with others committed dacoity of cash of Rs. 4,00,000/, gold ornaments, one pistol, 12 nos of cartridge and 7 nos of mobile phones from the house of the informant.",ISSUE
"

"Whether on the relevant date, time and place, The accused along with others were carrying fire arms like guns for unlawful purpose, i.e for commission of dacoity.
 5.",ISSUE
"In order to prove this case, the prosecution has examined all total six numbers of witnesses and marked the documents as Ext.1 and Ext.1/1.",ANALYSIS
"On the other hand, neither any witness is examined nor any document is marked from the side of the defence.",ANALYSIS
Out of the prosecution witnesses P.W.1 is the informant.,ANALYSIS
"P.W.2, P.W.3, P.W.4, P.W.5 and P.W.6 are the father, younger brother, mother, wife and sisterin law of the informant.",ANALYSIS
"6. After thoroughly analysing the evidence on record, it is observed that the informant(P.W.4) has stated that he does not know the accused Santosh Munda who is standing in the dock.",ANALYSIS
"He has further stated that on 18.12.2010 at about 6.30 PM while he was at home, four to five unknown masked persons being armed with gun entered into his house and taken away cash of Rs. 4,00,000/ and gold ornament weighing about 10 varis from his house.",ANALYSIS
He has further deposed that they assaulted and gave a Maoist letter to him and also they have taken way four cell phones from his house.,ANALYSIS
"On next day morning he lodged the FIR at P.S. On his cross examination, he has stated that all the above persons have wrapped their faces by cloth and the accused who is standing in the dock was not present there at the relevant time.",ANALYSIS
"
7. P.W.2 is the father of the informant who has stated that at the relevant time he was watching TV at his house and about 10 to 12 unknown masked persons entered into their house being armed with gun and other 10 persons standing outside their house.",ANALYSIS
"He has further deposed that, they have broken their boxes, almirahs and taken away cash of Rs. 4,00,000/ and 150 gm of gold ornaments.",ANALYSIS
He has further deposed that they have also taken the licenced gun of the the informant.,ANALYSIS
"In his cross examination, he has stated that all the culprits have wrapped their faces by cloth.",ANALYSIS
"8. P.W.3 who is the younger brother of the informant has stated that, he has not seen the accused Santosh Munda who is standing in the dock and at the relevant time he was absent from his house and on return he heard from his family members that number of persons entered into their house and took away cash of Rs.4,00,000/, 10 to 12 varis of gold and his identity card.",ANALYSIS
"9. P.W.4 is the mother of the informant has stated that, she has not seen the accused prior to her examination and the occurrence took place four years back inside their house.",ANALYSIS
She further deposed that at the relevant time she has not seen the occurrence and she was watching TV in another room.,ANALYSIS
"10. The wife of the informant(P.W.5) has stated that at the relevant time she was in a separate room and her husband informed her that some persons entered into their house and took away cash of Rs.
4,00,000/ and gold ornaments weighing about 10 varis.",ANALYSIS
11. P.W.6 is the wife of the younger brother of the informant.,ANALYSIS
She has stated that at the relevant time while she was sitting inside her room at a sudden ten to fifteen persons being wrapped on their faces entered into her house.,ANALYSIS
"She further deposed that they were armed with gun, pistol and sword and they snatched away her gold chain from her neck and they have also taken away about 10 varis of gold ornaments and cash of Rs. 4,00,000/ from their house.",ANALYSIS
She further deposed that they slapped her during the occurrence.,ANALYSIS
In her cross examination she has stated that she cannot identify anyone as they have wrapped their faces.,ANALYSIS
"12. It is needless to say that in a criminal trial, at very inception the prosecution is required to establish the complicity and involvement of the accused in terms of the charge he is facing under the trial.",ANALYSIS
"Once his complicity is established, the prosecution shall prove the alleged overt act or omission committed by the accused by adducing legal evidence to fix the criminal liability on the accused.",ANALYSIS
"Where primafacie complicity of the accused is established, a court shall make a judicial scrutiny to access whether the proved overt acts committed by the accused attracts the penal provision and declares the penal liability on the accused in terms of charge.",ANALYSIS
"Alternatively it can be said complicity can only be established by proving the ""actus reus"" of the accused.",ANALYSIS
"On analysing the evidence in the present case at hand, it is found that none of the prosecution witness including the informant and injured has whispered a single word showing the complicity of the present accused in connection with this case.",ANALYSIS
"When the prosecution evidence fails to establish the primafacie complicity of the accused in the present case, it was a futile exercise to make further judicial investigation of the evidence adduced on behalf of the prosecution to find out their guilty in terms of the charge.",ANALYSIS
"13. In this case at hand all the prosecution witnesses have stated that some unknown persons entered into their house being armed with gun and taken away cash of Rs. 4,00,000/ and gold ornaments.",ANALYSIS
None of the prosecution witness has stated the involvement of the present accused into the alleged crime.,ANALYSIS
Even they have categorically stated that they do not know the present accused who was standing in the dock during course of their examination.,ANALYSIS
Though the FIR has been proved by the informant as Ext.1 in this case.,ANALYSIS
The contents of the same have not been proved by him.,ANALYSIS
"The law is fairly well settled that, FIR is not a substantive piece of evidence and the same can only be used for the purpose of corroboration or contradiction to the maker thereof.",ANALYSIS
"14. Hence, basing on the above reason, this court come to irresistible conclusion that the prosecution is utterly failed to bring home the charges against the present accused.",RATIO
As such he is entitled to clean acquittal.,RATIO
"In the result, I found the present accused is not guilty for the commission of offence u/s 395 of IPC and 25/27 of Arms Act and he is acquitted therefrom as per section 235(1) of Cr.P.C.",RPC
He be set at liberty forthwith.,RPC

"appellant and two others were convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge, Gohilwad, under ss. 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code for the murder of Kanji and they were sentenced to imprisonment for life under the former section and to seven years' rigorous imprisonment under the latter.",RLC
The sentence were concurrent.,RLC
On appeal the High Court set aside the convictionof Nanji Ravji but upheld the convictions and sentences of the appellant and Karamshi Bhawan.,RLC
"
The appellant has Come in appeal to this Court by Special leave.",FAC
"
 The deceased Kanji was rather an unsavoury character in village Chiroda and it is alleged that he had a illicit connection with Shrimati Shantu the sister of Karamshi and also used to follow about Smt. Baghu the sister of the appellant for a similar object.",FAC
"It is stated that five days before the occurrence the appellant Karsan, Karamshi, Nanji and Gumansinh approver met and decided to murder the appellant.",FAC
With that object in view Gumansinh approver was to decoy the deceased to the Vadi of the appellant and there the murder was to be committed.,FAC
"At about sunset on March 19, 1958, the deceased was decoyed to the place as previously arranged and there he was murdered by the appellant who gave him a few blows.",FAC
with a sharp cutting instrument called Dharia.,FAC
According to the statement of the approver the dead body was wrapped in the scarf of the deceased and was carried by the appellant from the place of the murder to the dry bed of the river and there it was burried in a pit.,FAC
"Nothing was heard of the murder or of the deceased till on March 26, 1958, a brother of the deceased made a report to the police about his disappearance and that he suspected the three uncles of the appellant, subsequently the appellant and the other accused persons were taken into custody by the police.",FAC
"One of them while in the custody of the police, was allowed to go to the village and he asked the help of Shamji and Manilal P.Ws.",FAC
He also made a confession to them and they reported the matter to the police.,FAC
"On March 31, 1958, Gumansinh and Karamshi made confessionswhich were recorded by a Magistrate.",FAC
"Between March 26 and March 31, recoveries of various articles were made.",FAC
"At the instance of the appellant, it is stated, the dead body and then the head of the deceased was recovered from a distant well.",FAC
"At the instance of Nanji on March 28, 1958 a scarf was, discovered in the pit in which the dead body was according to the approver, buried.",FAC
"On the scarf, there were some hairs which on analysis by the Chemical Examiner were found to be similar to the hairs of the appellant and of the deceased.",FAC
"A day previous, i. e. March 27, 1958, at the instance of the appellant silver buttons which were stained with human blood were discovered from the field of the appellant at small stick like a button belonging to the deceased was also found at his instance.",FAC
"
 The High Court rejected the confession of Karamshi on the ground that it was not voluntary.",FAC
"
It acquitted Nanji on the ground that there were no corroboration in regard to him of the approver's statement, the place where the dead body was buried was not discovered at his instance, his production of stick and shirt and trousers from his house was of no consequence, and the oral evidence was contrary to the medical evidence and Karamshi's confessional statement could not be used against Nanji.",RLC
"
 In regard to the appellant the High Court accepted the testimony of the approver as being a reliable piece of evidence.",FAC
"It attached no importance to the recovery of the cutting instrument, Dharia, nor to the discovery of the stick (Dhoka) at his instance.",FAC
"But the High Court did rely upon the discovery of the dead body of the deceased, i.e. the trunk and the head, at the instance of the appellant and of the blood-stained buttons also at his instance and attached importance to scarf recovered from the pit where the dead body was alleged to have been first buried and which had hairs both of the appellant as well as of the deceased.",FAC
"
         It was argued for the appellant that the evidence of the approver, even though it had been accepted as true, was not corroborated in material particulars connecting the appellant with the offence.",FAC
On the other hand it was contradicted.,FAC
"
The approver had stated that the dead body was buried in a pit in the dry bed of the river but when that pit was dug up the dead body was not found there and only a piece of ulna bone and a heel of a human foot were found and all there recoveries had been made earlier and so could not be called corroborative in material particulars.",FAC
"
It was further submitted that there was no evidence to show as to when and how the body of the deceased was removed from the pit, dismembered and thrown into the well.",FAC
"The recovery of the scarf, it was pointed out, was an innocuous circumstance because on the evidence produced it had not been shown to belong to the appellant but to his father and the evidence of the Chemical Examiner was not sufficient to prove that the hairs on the scarf were of the appellant or of the deceased because the Chemical Examiner was certainly no expert on this matter and his evidence was, not admissible under s. 45 of the Evidence Act, and at the most, according to the Chemical Examiner's report the hairs resembled those of the appellant.",FAC
And secondly according to the approver the dead body of the deceased was wrapped in his own pania (scarf).,FAC
"It was further submitted that the statement in regard to the recovery of the trunk and the head will only show that the appellant knew where the trunk and the head were, which at the most would lead to an inference of an offence under 8. 201 and not of 8.",FAC
What the law requires in the case of an accomplice's evidence is that there should be such corroboration of the material Parts of the story connecting the accused with the crime as will satisfy reasonable minds that the approver can be regardedas a truthful witness.,ANALYSIS
The corroboration need not be direct evidence of the commission of the offence by the accused.,ANALYSIS
If it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime it will be sufficient and the nature of the corroboration will depend on and vary with the circumstances of each case.,ANALYSIS
Vemireddy Satyanarayan Reddy v. The State of Hyderabad.,PRE_RELIED
"
 The confessional statement made by the approver on March 31, 1958 gave the following facts connecting the appellant with the murder.",ANALYSIS
"
(1) The appellant gave dharia blow to the deceased.",ANALYSIS
The dharia had already been discovered and it has been disregarded from the evidence by the High Court as being of no importance.,ANALYSIS
The next thing stated by the approver was that the deceased's body was tied in a pania (scarf).,ANALYSIS
He did not state that the scarf in which it was bound belonged to the appellant.,ANALYSIS
The next fact stated by him was that the appellant carried the body of the deceased and then it was buried in a pit and lastly he stated that the appellant had told him that the head of the deceased had been thrown into a well.,ANALYSIS
None of these recoveries in the circumstances of this case are corroborative of the statement of the approver to the extent of connecting the appellant with the offence committed.,ANALYSIS
"On the other hand, they are somewhat contradictory of the statement because the pania (scarf) which was found in the pit has now been stated to belong to the appellant.",ANALYSIS
"The dead body was not found in the pit, the head had already been discovered and the trunk had also been taken out of the well.",ANALYSIS
In these circumstances it was submitted that the approver's statement cannot be said to have been corroborated in material particulars.,ANALYSIS
"
 But there are other circumstances which have to be considered even if the evidence of the approver is held not to be very helpful to the prosecution.",ANALYSIS
"Firstly, there is the pointing out ofthe dead body by the appellant from the well; secondly, the discovery of the blood-stained (stained with human blood) buttons at the instance of the appellant i thirdly the scarf which has been held to belong to the appellant and which was found from the pit pointed out by the co-accused Nanji and fourthly by the presence of the hairs of the appellant and of the deceased on that scarf.",ANALYSIS
"
 The mere fact that the dead body was pointed out by the appellant or was discovered as a result of a statement made by him would not necessarily lead to the conclusion of the offence of murder.",ANALYSIS
"
But there are other circumstances which have to be considered.",ANALYSIS
"The discovery of the buttons with bloodstains at the instance of the appellant is a circumstance which may raise the presumption of the participation of the appellant in the murder, In Wasin Khan v. The State of Uttar Pradesh (1), it was held that the recent and unexplained possession of stolen property would be presumptive evidence against a prisoner on a charge of robbery as also of a charge of murder.",PRE_RELIED
But it must depend upon the circumstance of each case.,ANALYSIS
The third piece of evidence to be considered is the recovery of the pania i.e. scarf.,ANALYSIS
No doubt there is no statement by the approver that the scarf in which the dead body was taken was that of the appellant.,ANALYSIS
"
But a scarf has been found which the High Court has held as belonging to the appellant and hairs were found on that scarf.",ANALYSIS
It was argued that the finding of the hairs was of no consequence and at least the Chemical Examiner was not he proper expert who could depose as to the similarity or other wise of the hairs.,ANALYSIS
"The writers on medical jurisprudence, however, have stated that from the microscopic examination of the hairs it is possible to say whether they are of the same or of different colours or sizes and from the examination it may help in deciding where the hairs come from.",ANALYSIS
"InTaylor's Medical Jurisprudence (1956 Edn.) Vol. 1, at page 122, sine cases are given showing that hairs were identified as belonging to particular persons.",ANALYSIS

       This Criminal Revision Petition filed under Section 397 read
with 401 Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 by the Advocate for the
petitioner praying that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to set aside
the impugned judgment dated 15/26.2.2010 passed by the Civil Judge
(Jr.Dn.)and Judicial Magistrate First Class, Sira in C.C.No.409/2007
and judgment dated 30.9.2010 passed by the Presiding Officer, Fast
Track Court-II, Tumkur, in Criminal Appeal No.29/2010, in so far as
this petitioner is concerned, by allowing this Criminal Revision
Petition consequently acquit the petitioner/A1 of offence punishable
under Section 498(A) of Indian Penal Code.

       This Criminal Revision Petition having been heard and reserved
on 11.6.2012 and coming on for pronouncement of orders this day, the
Court delivered the following:-

                                     ORDER",PREAMBLE
"
 Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Government Pleader.",NONE
2. The petitioner was the accused before the trial court in the following circumstances:,FAC
"The complainant alleged that accused no.1, the petitioner herein and she were in love with each other and had decided to marry, but before they could marry, she was pregnant with a child of the petitioner and she had informed the petitioner of the same.",FAC
"On learning of the pregnancy, it is alleged that the petitioner absconded.",FAC
"
The complainant claimed that on 16.11.2006, she went to Dwaralu village, which was the petitioner's native village and met his parents and inquired about his whereabouts.",FAC
She also intimated them about the relationship that she and the petitioner had.,FAC
The parents of the petitioner had advised the complainant that they would secure the presence of their son and would ensure that they are married.,FAC
"In the meantime, they requested her not to institute any case against the petitioner.",FAC
"With that assurance, she had returned to Bangalore.",FAC
"
 3. It transpires that the petitioner, along with an advocate, had met the complainant and had expressed that the marriage between the petitioner and the complainant was not possible, since they belonged to different castes and that the families may not reconcile to the same.",FAC
"
 In this background, the complainant had again met accused no.2, the mother of the petitioner and intimated her about the petitioner's attitude.",FAC
"She was again reassured that the petitioner would be persuaded to marry her, but nothing changed.",FAC
"Therefore, the complainant lodged a complaint before the J.P.Nagar Police Station on 24.11.2006.",FAC
"On 25.11.2006, the petitioner is said to have gone along with the complainant to J.P.Nagar Police Station and the Police had convinced the petitioner that he had no choice, but to marry the complainant.",FAC
"The complainant, therefore, had claimed that they were married at Ganapathi temple at 4th Block, J.P.Nagar, Bangalore and the mother of the petitioner had also attended the marriage.",FAC
"4. It is her further case that since the petitioner had expressed that he had no money to set up a home, she had paid cash of `50,000/- and also handed over two bangles, in order that he may use the same for setting up a home.",FAC
"It is her allegation that the petitioner did not do so, but misused the amount for himself.",FAC
"Thereafter, on 29.12.2006, the complainant is again said to have approached the J.P.Nagar Police and informed them of the conduct of the petitioner.",FAC
"The presence of the petitioner was again secured on 31.12.2006 and it is claimed that there was reproachment brought about by the Police once again, but however, the petitioner is said to have deserted the complainant by February 2007.",FAC
"Therefore, the complainant is said to have visited Dwaralu village to meet the parents of the petitioner.",FAC
But the father of the petitioner had not permitted her to enter their house and had chased her away.,FAC
"Therefore, she had proceeded to the Tavarekere Police Station, which refused to receive any complaint.",FAC
"Thereafter, with the intervention of the Superintendent of Police, Tumkur, a complaint is said to have been lodged on 9.2.2007,which was forwarded to the jurisdictional Police and a case came to be registered.",FAC
"Further investigation having been taken up, a charge-sheet was filed against the petitioner and his parents.",FAC
"Since the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried, the prosecution examined 13 witnesses and marked Exhibits - P1 to P24.
 5.",FAC
"On the basis of the material produced and the allegations made, the trial court had framed the following point for consideration: ""1. Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt that on 2.02.2007, at about 6.00 p.m., at Dwaralu village, accused being the husband of complainant  B.L.Suneetha, Accused No.2 and 3 relatives of Accused No.1 made quarrel with her and gave both physical and mental harassment without providing food and shelter in their house and thrown out from the house and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 498(A) read with 34 Indian Penal Code?
 2. What Order? """,FAC
"
 The trial court answered the same in the affirmative and convicted the petitioner for an offence punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as ' the IPC' for brevity) and they were sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year for the said offence.",RLC
"The same having been carried in appeal, it was set aside and modified.",RLC
The parents of the petitioner were acquitted and the conviction and order of sentence against the petitioner was confirmed.,RLC
It is that which is under challenge in the present petition.,FAC
"
 6. The learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that the courts below have not appreciated the ingredients of Section 498A of the IPC.",ARG_PETITIONER
"It is suggested that the ingredients are that the husband of a woman should have subjected her to cruelty and such cruelty should be with a view to coerce her or any person related to her, to meet any unlawful demand of any property or valuable security and that the harassment is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.",ARG_PETITIONER
"Therefore, it would be evident that the law contemplates as a precondition that there should be a valid marriage in accordance with law between the complainant and the accused and the husband should have harassed his wife or treated her with cruelty to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security.",ARG_PETITIONER
"In the present case on hand, the complainant had not at all proved her marriage with the petitioner, except producing certain photographs.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
Significantly, the negatives of the same were never brought on record.",ARG_PETITIONER
"On the basis of such evidence, the petitioner could not be termed to be the legally wedded husband of the complainant.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
Therefore, the very first precondition to establish an offence punishable under the said Section is absent.",ARG_PETITIONER
"There is nothing on record to indicate the custom or rituals, in accordance with which the alleged marriage had taken place.",ARG_PETITIONER
"The prosecution has sought to rely on Exhibit P.24, which is said to be an undertaking given by the petitioner before the J.P.Nagar Police, to the effect that he would take care of the complainant.",ARG_PETITIONER
This by itself would not establish that the complainant and the petitioner were legally wedded.,ARG_PETITIONER
"PWs 1 to 3 were residents of Dwaralu village, the native place of the petitioner.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
Significantly, they have not spoken about the valid marriage between the complainant and the petitioner.",ARG_PETITIONER
They have also not stated about the complainant and the petitioner having lived together as husband and wife.,ARG_PETITIONER
There is also no indication of any harassment caused by the petitioner to the complainant to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security.,ARG_PETITIONER
"PW.4, who was said to have been present when the complainant and the petitioner got married at the Ganapathi temple, has not spoken about the rituals and customs that were performed at the time of the marriage.",ARG_PETITIONER
He has also not endorsed about the complainant and the petitioner having lived together as husband and wife.,ARG_PETITIONER
"Apart from PW.12 and 13, who were again close relatives and had not stated about the rituals and customs performed at the valid marriage, all other witnesses were formal witnesses for the prosecution, whose evidence does not establish that there was marriage between the complainant and the petitioner.",ARG_PETITIONER
The courts below have glossed over this significant aspect and have treated the marriage as a `love marriage' and have proceeded to hold that the allegations would constitute an offence punishable under Section 498A of the IPC.,ARG_PETITIONER
"Significantly, the parents of the complainant have not been examined as witnesses in the case, atleast to the extent of proving the valid marriage.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
 7. The learned Counsel would place reliance on a judgment in the case of State vs. Prasanna Kumar Senapati, 2007 Cri.LJ 1344, which was an identical case, whereby the alleged marriage at a temple was sought to be characterised as a valid marriage and the Orissa High Court had negated the assertion that there was a valid marriage, in the absence of a priest who conducted the marriage having been examined and other circumstances, which did not implicate the accused in having brought about the death of the alleged wife.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
 8. Reliance is also placed on the case of D.Velusamy vs.D.Patchaiammal, 2010(7) Supreme 321, which arose out of a case for maintenance under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, (hereinafter referred to as ' the Cr.P.C.' for brevity) and with reference to the expression `wife' as employed in the said Section, the decision of a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court in Vimala(K) vs. Veeraswamy(K), (1991) 2 SCC 375, has been followed, wherein it was laid down that the expression `wife' as employed in Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., includes a woman, who has been divorced by a husband or who has obtained a divorce from her husband and has not remarried.",ARG_PETITIONER
The woman not having the legal status of a wife was thus brought within the inclusive definition of the term `wife' consistent with the objective.,ARG_PETITIONER
"However, under the law, a second wife, whose marriage is void on account of the survival of the first marriage, is not a legally wedded wife and is therefore not entitled to maintenance under the provision and the same has been followed in holding that a woman cannot claim to be the wife, unless it is established that the man was not already married, in that, the first marriage was not subsisting.",ARG_PETITIONER
"The learned counsel would further submit that this is also consistent with the view in the case of Savitaben Somabhai Bhatiya vs. State of Gujarat, AIR 2005 SC 1809, while it has been observed that the Legislature considered it necessary to include within the scope of the provision, an illegitimate child, but, it has not done so with respect to a woman not lawfully married and however, desirable it may be, to take note of the plight of the unfortunate woman.",ARG_PETITIONER
"The legislative intent being clearly reflected in Section 125 of the Cr.P.C., there was no claim for enlarging its scope by introducing any artificial definition to include a woman not lawfully married in the expression `wife'.",ARG_PETITIONER
"Therefore, the learned Counsel would submit that the courts below have hence overlooked the primary ingredients, which would necessarily have to be present to establish that the offence punishable under Section 498A of the IPC had been committed.",ARG_PETITIONER
"The Counsel, hence, seeks that the petition be allowed and the judgment of the lower appellate court be set aside insofar as the petitioner is concerned.",ARG_PETITIONER
"9. On the other hand, the learned Government Pleader would submit that the primary contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that there is no valid marriage between the complainant and the petitioner and would submit that the question has been answered in the case of Reema Aggarwal v.s Anupam and others, (2004) 3 SCC 199.",ARG_RESPONDENT
"With specific reference to a question as to who would be covered by the expression `husband' for attracting Section 498A, the apex court has held that etymologically in terms of the definitions of `husband' and `marriage' as given in the various law lexicons and dictionaries, the existence of a valid marriage may appear to be sine qua non for applying a penal provision and has opined that the concept of marriage to constitute the relationship of husband and wife may require strict interpretation where claims for civil rights, right to property, etc., may follow or flow and a liberal approach and the different perception cannot be an anathema when the question of curbing a social evil, such as, dowry is concerned.
",ARG_RESPONDENT
"The apex court has further observed that if the legality of the marriage itself is an issue, further legalistic problems do arise.",ARG_RESPONDENT
"In that, if the validity of the marriage itself is under legal scrutiny, the demand of dowry in respect of an invalid marriage would be legally not recognizable.",ARG_RESPONDENT
"Even then, the purpose for which Section 498A and Section 304-B IPC as well as Section 113E of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 were introduced, cannot be lost sight of.",ARG_RESPONDENT
"The legislation enacted with some policy, to curb and alleviate some public evil rampant in society, requires to be interpreted with a certain element of realism.",ARG_RESPONDENT
"Therefore, the legalistic niceties would destroy the purpose of the provisions and therefore concluded that whatever be the legitimacy of the marriage itself, for the limited purpose of Section 498A and 304B of the Indian Penal Code, the interpretation known as purposive construction would come into play in such circumstances and the absence of a definition of `husband' is specifically include such persons who contract marriage ostensibly and cohabit with such woman, in the purported exercise of their role and status as `husband' is no ground to exclude them from the purview of the said sections.",ARG_RESPONDENT
"
 10. The learned Government Pleader would therefore rely on the said judgment to support the contention that a legally valid marriage is not a precondition.",ARG_RESPONDENT
"This decision has been relied upon and applied in yet another judgment of the apex court in the case of U.Suvetha vs. State by Inspector of Police, 2009 (2) Crimes 357 and has cited with approval the opinion of the Kerala High Court in the case of John Idiculla vs. State of Kerala, 2005 MLJ(Crl.) 841, where a wider meaning to the word `second wife' has been given in the following words:- ""25.",ANALYSIS
"The test under Section 498A Indian Penal Code is whether in the facts of each case, it is probable that a woman is treated by friends, relatives, husband or society as a ""wife"" or as a mere ""mistress"".",ANALYSIS
"If from the pleading and evidence the Court finds that the woman concerned is regarded as wife and not as a mere mistress, she can be considered to be a `wife' and consequently as `the relative of the husband' for purpose of Section 498A IPC.",ANALYSIS
"
          Proof of a legal marriage in the rigid sense as required under civil law is unnecessary for establishing an offence under Section 498A IPC.",ANALYSIS
"The expression ""marriage"" or ""relative"" can be given only a diluted meaning which a common man or society may attribute to those concepts in the common parlance, for the purpose of Section 498A IPC.",ANALYSIS
"A second wife who is treated as wife by the husband, relatives, friends or society can be considered to be `the relative of the husband' for the purpose of Section 498A of IPC.",ANALYSIS
"If she inflicts cruelty on the legally-wedded wife of the husband, an offence under Section 498A IPC will not lie against her.""
 ",ANALYSIS
"And the learned Government Pleader would submit that the first ingredient of Section 498A stands satisfied insofar as the present case on hand, in that, there are certain photographs produced coupled with the fact that the petitioner had given an undertaking before the jurisdictional police and the eye-witness to the marriage were sufficient to establish that the petitioner had married the respondent.",ARG_RESPONDENT
"
It was not even a case where the marriage was alleged to be a second marriage, thereby rendering it a void marriage.",ANALYSIS
It is not the case of the petitioner that the complainant was a stranger to him.,ANALYSIS
"The insistence on strict proof of marriage, as laid down in the above decisions, is not so.",ANALYSIS
"
 11. Insofar as the cruelty which requires to be established is concerned, is on account of the fact that there was reluctance on the part of the petitioner to marry the complainant citing lack of financial independence, compelling the complainant to part with valuable property, coupled with the fact that cruelty, as contemplated under Section 498A has been defined in a wider sense and cannot be restricted in the manner as sought to be canvassed by the learned counsel for the petitioner.",ANALYSIS
"The punishment has been imposed with particular reference to the degree of cruelty that has been established and therefore, it is not a case which would warrant interference by this court in a revision and hence, the Government Pleader prays that the petition be dismissed.",ANALYSIS
"
 12. In the above facts and circumstances and with reference to the law as laid down by the apex court, for purposes of Section 498A of the IPC, though it may not be essential that a legally valid marriage is established, it was necessary to establish that the petitioner and the complainant had lived together as husband and wife.",ANALYSIS
"In this regard, there is sadly no evidence is forthcoming.",ANALYSIS
"Therefore, even the wider definition applied to the expressions `husband' and `marriage' with reference to the decisions of the apex court referred to hereinabove would not come to the aid of the prosecution.",ANALYSIS
"Further, insofar as the second limb of the requirements under Section 498A is also not established for the reason that there is not even an allegation of the petitioner having demanded or coerced the complainant to meet any unlawful demand and of the complainant having been harassed on her failure to meet such demand.",ANALYSIS
"The mere allegation of desertion, whether it was bordered on cruelty, was never within the purview of the courts below and it is outside the scope of this revision petition.",ANALYSIS
"
Therefore, the primary ingredients necessary to constitute an offence punishable under Section 498A were clearly absent and hence the conviction of the petitioner by both the courts below is clearly bad in law.",RATIO
"
 Accordingly, the petition is allowed and the judgment of the courts below is set aside insofar as the conviction of the present petitioner is concerned.",RPC

He also expressed his ignorance about enmity between the accused appellant No.1 and the deceased.,FAC

He stated that the accused/appellant Dwik then had gone to the market at Shillong and had returned later in the evening at about 8:30 PM.,FAC
He expressed that he did not know if there was any hostility between the accused/appellant and the deceased.,FAC
"
 17.     Mr KC Gautam has emphatically argued that the FIR having been lodged after 48 hours of the incident and that too without any explanation, the prosecution case on this ground alone ought to have been rejected as unreliable.",ARG_PETITIONER
"This is coupled with the fact that though the wife of the deceased at the time of filing of the FIR was present, she was not examined by the prosecution.",ARG_PETITIONER
"The learned counsel urged that if PW-5 had really identified the accused/appellant No.2, there was no conceivable reason to omit his name in the FIR.",ARG_PETITIONER
PW-5 and PW-6 having failed to identify the accused/appellants their evidence besides being partisan ought to be rejected.,ARG_PETITIONER
"
 18.     He argued further that as the witnesses contradicted each other qua their statements under Section 164 CrPC, the prosecution had miserably failed to prove the charge against the accused/appellants.",ARG_PETITIONER
"Mr KC Gautam urged that the statement of the accused/appellant No.2 under Section 164 CrPC being apparently non-culpatory, the same cannot be taken note of in support of the charge.",ARG_PETITIONER
"He argued further that as no weapon of assault had been seized, the prosecution case is wholly untrustworthy and the impugned judgment and order if allowed to stand will result in gross in-justice.",ARG_PETITIONER
"18.A The learned Addl. PP as against this has contended that a conjoint reading of the PW-1, PW-2, PW-5, PW-6 & PW-8 proved the charge against the accused/appellant to the hilt and no interference with the conviction and sentence is called for.",ARG_RESPONDENT
"Drawing the attention of this Court to Section 9 and 156 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), Mr Khan has sought to impress upon this Court that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses having knit a set of unimpeachable circumstances unerringly pointing to the guilt of the accused/appellants, the impugned judgment and order cannot be faulted with.",ARG_RESPONDENT
To reinforce his submission he relied on the decisions of the Apex Court in Ravi Kumar-Vs.-State of Punjab in 2005 9 SCC 315 and Dalbir Singh –Vs.- State of Haryana in 2008 11 SCC 425.,ARG_RESPONDENT
We have carefully considered the materials on record and the arguments advanced.,ANALYSIS
"It is patent from the testimony of the Investigating Officer that even before the FIR had been received by the Police, probe into the incident had been initiated after making a GD entry of the information received.",ANALYSIS
"In that view of the matter, the FIR lodged 48 hours after the incident is not the first in point of time.",ANALYSIS
As it is an FIR is not substantive piece.,ANALYSIS
"Thus the omission to mention the name(s) of the accused/appellants in the FIR, in the opinion of this Court does not per se strike at the root of the prosecution case.",ANALYSIS
"
 20.     The evidence of PW-1, PW-5, PW-6 and PW-8 when considered as a whole leave no manner of doubt about the identification of the accused/appellants as members of the group of three who had trespassed into the house of the deceased and had assaulted him with a knife.",ANALYSIS
"Whereas PW-5 was an eyewitness of the incident identified the accused/appellant No.2, PW-6 has assertively stated to have recognized the accused/appellants to be amongst the three persons coming out from the compound of her father’s house immediately after the incident.",ANALYSIS
These three persons in a group were encountered by PW-1 and PW-8 at or about the time of incident and were found hurrying away from the place of occurrence.,ANALYSIS
"Though the weapon of assault i.e. the knife as referred to by PW-5 could not be retrieved, the evidence of the Doctor as well as the postmortem report not only prove that the dead body bore three incised wounds caused by a sharp cutting weapon, the ocular version of PW-5 about the assault by a knife stood corroborated thereby.",ANALYSIS
The statements made by the PW-5 and PW-6 in particular under Section 164 CrPC are also substantially in harmony with their evidence at the trial.,ANALYSIS
"The minor contradictions in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, in our opinion do not materially affect its case on merit.",ANALYSIS
"Non- examination of the wife of the deceased is also not fatal, the charge having been proved otherwise.",ANALYSIS
A bare reading of the statement of the accused/appellants under Section 164 CrPC does not show any evidence to conclude that his conviction on the basis thereof is permissible in law.,ANALYSIS
The evidence of the prosecution witnesses however read in conjunction build a chain of circumstances in identifying the accused/appellants to be assailant without any matter of doubt.,ANALYSIS
"
 21.     The decision of Ravi Kumar (Supra) deals with unusual and unexplained delay in the filing of the FIR.",PRE_RELIED
"The learned Lordship’s had observed further that in the event where ocular evidence is cogent and credible, medical evidence to the contrary cannot corrode the evidentiary value of the former.",PRE_RELIED
"
 22.     In Dalbir Singh (Supra), the Hon’ble Apex Court propounded that the prosecution witnesses can identify a person with whom he may be fairly acquainted with or from his voice, gait, features etc.",PRE_RELIED
The propositions enunciated in these decisions provide ample support to the prosecution case in the present factual setting.,ANALYSIS

"We have perused the impugned judgment and order and for the reasons recorded herein above, we are in agreement with the ultimate conclusion recorded therein.",RPC

The proposed substantial questions of law framed in the Memorandum of appeal by the Appellants-Revenue are quoted below for ready reference:- ""(1) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in law as well as facts in directing the M/s.

 (3) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in holding that few companies are functionally different from the assessee when it satisfies all the qualitative and quantitative filters applied by the TPO.",FAC
"The tribunal had used a narrower functionality filter than the TPO, but had not tested other comparables against the narrower functionality filter applied by it.?""

"Software AG Bangalore Technologies Pvt Ltd., 5/11 incurred in foreign currency, both from the Export Turnover and Total Turnover, without appreciating the fact that the statue allows exclusion of such expenditure expressly only from the Export Turnover by way of specific definition of export turnover defined in the Act, while there is no specific provision is Section 10A warranting exclusion of the above expenses from the Total Turnover?""",FAC

 4. The learned Tribunal, after discussing the rival contentions of both the Appellants-Revenue and the Respondent-assessee, has given the following findings against Revenue with regard to various issues raised before it with regard to `Transfer Pricing' and `Transfer Pricing Adjustments' made by the concerned authorities below.",ANALYSIS
"We consider it appropriate to quote the relevant portions hereunder: M/s. Software AG Bangalore Technologies Pvt Ltd., 7/11 ""21.",ANALYSIS
"We have considered the submissions of the ld. counsel for the assessee and are of the view that in the light of judicial precedent cited by the ld. counsel for the assessee, turnover filter has to be applied in the present case.",ANALYSIS
The assessee's turnover is Rs.32.84 crores and the assessee cannot be compared with a company whose turnover is more than 200 crores as laid down in the decision referred to above.,ANALYSIS
"Following the aforesaid decision, we hold that the aforesaid 5 companies be excluded from the list of comparable companies.",ANALYSIS
"
 22. The ld. counsel then brought to our notice that Bodhtree Consulting Ltd. and KALS Information Systems Ltd. have been held to be functionally not comparable with a company like the assessee, which is purely a software development service provider.",ANALYSIS
"In this regard, the ld. counsel for the assessee drew our attention to the ITAT Bangalore Bench decision in the case of CISCO Systems India Pvt. Ltd., IT(TP)A No.271/Bang/2014, order dated 14.8.2014.",ANALYSIS
"In this case for the AY 2009-10, the Tribunal M/s. Software AG Bangalore Technologies Pvt Ltd., 8/11 considered the comparability of Bodhtree Consulting Ltd. as well as KALS Information Systems Ltd, with a company engaged in the business of software development services.",ANALYSIS

"It is also relevant to point out that in the case of CISCO Systems India Pvt. Ltd.

""" Conclusion: 55. A substantial quantum of international trade and transactions depends upon the fair and quick judicial dispensation in such cases.",PRE_RELIED
"Had it been a case of substantial question of interpretation of provisions of Double Taxation Avoidance Treaties (DTAA), interpretation of provisions of the Income Tax Act or Overriding Effect of the Treaties over the Domestic Legislations or the questions like Treaty Shopping, Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), Transfer of Shares in Tax Havens (like in the case of Vodafone etc.), if based on relevant facts, such substantial questions of law could be raised before the High Court under Section M/s.",PRE_RELIED
"Software AG Bangalore Technologies Pvt Ltd., 10/11 260-A of the Act, the Courts could have embarked upon such exercise of framing and answering such substantial question of law.",PRE_RELIED
"On the other hand, the appeals of the present tenor as to whether the comparables have been rightly picked up or not, Filters for arriving at the correct list of comparables have been rightly applied or not, do not in our considered opinion, give rise to any substantial question of law.",PRE_RELIED
"
 56. We are therefore of the considered opinion that the present appeals filed by the Revenue do not give rise to any substantial question of law and the suggested substantial questions of law do not meet the requirements of Section 260-A of the Act and thus the appeals filed by the Revenue are found to be devoid of merit and the same are liable to be dismissed.
 57.",PRE_RELIED
"We make it clear that the same yardsticks and parameters will have to be applied, even if such appeals are filed by the Assessees, because, there may be cases where the Tribunal giving its own reasons and findings has found certain comparables to be good comparables to arrive at an `Arm's Length Price' in the case of the assessees with which the assessees may not be satisfied and have filed M/s.",PRE_RELIED
"Software AG Bangalore Technologies Pvt Ltd., 11/11 such appeals before this Court.",PRE_RELIED

We are therefore of the considered opinion that the present appeals filed by the Revenue do not give rise to any substantial question of law and the suggested substantial questions of law do not meet the requirements of Section 260-A of the Act and thus the appeals filed by the Revenue are found to be devoid of merit and the same are liable to be dismissed.,PRE_RELIED

JUDGMENT (PER A.K.MENON, J.)",PREAMBLE
1.  This order disposes of all the above seventeen Sales Tax References and two Writ Petitions.,FAC
"For the purpose of the present judgment, we refer to the facts and issues raised in Sales Tax Reference No.11 of 2006, Writ Petition No.2055 of 2003 and Sales Tax Reference No.49 of 2006.",FAC
"The issues that arise for consideration pertains to additive flavour compounds only and synthetic essential oils, fragrances, etc.
 ",FAC
"Vide order 31st March, 2006, the following questions were referred to this Court:- (i) Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, was the Tribunal justified in negating the revenue's interpretation of the words ""and their compounds"" in schedule entry C-I-19 as covering only the compounds of natural and synthetic essential oils as not quite proper and interpreting the words ""and their compounds"", therein to mean the compounds of the aromatic chemicals as well.",ISSUE
"
 (ii) Whether on the facts an circumstances of the case, was the Tribunal justified in holding that the impugned product i.e. flavouring compound is compound covered by Schedule Entry C-I-19 and liable to tax @ 4 per cent from 1-1-1988 to 10-8-1988 and 1994-95 ?",ISSUE
"
 (iii) Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, was the Tribunal justified in concluding that the impugned product i.e. perfumery compound are compounds or aromatic chemicals within the meaning of Schedule Entry C-I-19 and hence liable to tax @ 4% for the period 1-1-1998 to 31-3-1995 ?",ISSUE
"
 2.  For the purpose of this judgment, we refer to the facts in the case of Sales Tax Reference No.47 of 2009.",FAC
"The Respondent- assessee is a manufacturer of Aromatic Chemicals, Flavouring Compounds, Natural and Synthetic Essential Oil and Fragrances, etc.",FAC
"The assessing authority levied a tax at 15% on the sales of flavouring compounds and perfumery compounds treating them as covered under entry C-II-78, with effect from 11th August,1988.",FAC
Perfumery compounds were also taxed under C-II-86 as fragrances and penalties were also levied.,FAC
"
 3.  According to the Respondent-assessee, sales of flavouring compounds and perfumery compounds were covered under entry C-I-19.",FAC
"The assessee filed a first appeal before the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax, who considered the above submissions but rejected them, holding that the assessing officer had not erred in treating the impugned sale as covered in schedule entry C-I-19.",FAC
The first Appellate Authority thus confirmed the order of the assessing authority with regard to levy of taxes.,FAC
"
 4.  Being aggrieved by the order of the first appellate authority, the appellant filed a second appeal before the Tribunal.",FAC
"The Appellate Tribunal, after hearing both sides, partly allowed the second appeal vide order dated 31st March, 2003 and held that during the period 11th August, 1988 to 31st March, 1994, the sale of flavouring compound was liable to be taxed at the rate of 15% being covered under schedule entry C- II-78.",FAC
"After the period 1st January, 1988 to 11th August, 1988 and during 1994-95 flavouring compounds were liable to be taxed at 4% being covered under entry C-I- 19.",FAC
"It was further held that perfumery compounds were liable to sales tax at 4% during the period 1st January, 1988 to 31st March, 1995.",FAC
"The claims pertaining to goods returned, set off, sale of REP licence, etc. were remanded to the Deputy Commissioner.",FAC
"
 5.   Mr. Sridharan, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the assessee in all these matters submitted that the arguments raised by the revenue before the Maharashtra Sales Tax Tribunal were as follows:- (a)  Entry C-I-19 does not cover compounds of aromatic chemicals but the entry covers only the compounds of natural / synthetic essential oils and no other compounds.
 (b)  Entry C-I-19 covers only the compounds which are sold as single entity in form which is almost pure.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
 (c)  Entry C-I-19 relates only to compounds treated individually i.e. without requirement of specific formulation.",ARG_PETITIONER
"In other words, it does not cover any prepared mixture.",ARG_PETITIONER
"On the three questions framed, he submitted that as far as the first question reproduced above, the Tribunal had answered this question in its judgment dated 31st March, 2003 as follows:- "" The reading of the entry C-I-19 done by the revenue is not quite proper.",ARG_PETITIONER
The words 'their compounds' therein would obviously mean the compounds of the Aromatic Chemicals and Synthetic and Natural Essential Oils.,ARG_PETITIONER
"They would certainly not mean compounds merely of synthetic and natural essential oils, as sought to be interpreted by the revenue.",ARG_PETITIONER
When the synthetic and natural oils themselves were covered by C-I-19 there was obviously no need to specify that even the compounds of such oils would also be covered by the same entry.,ARG_PETITIONER
"As compounds of various chemicals are covered by the term chemicals, the compounds of the aforesaid oils are also covered by the term 'synthetic and natural essential oils'.",ARG_PETITIONER
"In that view of the matter, it is absolutely clear that the words 'their compounds' in C-I- 19 means not the compounds of oils but the compounds of aromatic and oils....",ARG_PETITIONER
"Therefore, C-I-19 does include mixtures except culinary and flavour essences.",ARG_PETITIONER
"""
 6.  Mr.Sridharan submitted that ordinarily the use of semicolon in a classification creates a distinction between the terms of inputs before and after the semicolon.",ARG_PETITIONER
He relies upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Falcon Tyres V/s.,ARG_PETITIONER
"State of Karnataka reported in (2006) 6 SCC 530 in support of his submission that in the impugned entry C-I-19, no such semicolon is used in the entry and there was no distinction between 'aromatic chemicals' on the one other and 'natural and synthetic essential oils' on the hand.",ARG_PETITIONER
"Consequently, it is submitted that the words 'and their compounds' will refer to both, compounds of aromatic chemicals as well as compounds of natural and synthetic essential oils.",ARG_PETITIONER
"Mr.Sridharan further submits that in Union of India V/s. Pesticides Mfg & Formulators Assn. Of India reported in (2002) 7 SCC 410, the Apex Court has held that a compound is mixture of components and therefore, entry at C-I-19 includes mixtures of aromatic chemicals and 'natural and synthetic essential oils.",ARG_PETITIONER
The impugned products will not fall outside the entry merely on account of being a mixture.,ARG_PETITIONER
"
 7.  As far as the second question is concerned, Mr.Sridharan has submitted that the second question was relevant only for matters pertaining to M/s. International Flavours and Fragrances.",ARG_PETITIONER
He submitted that the terms in a classification entry must be interpreted using the principle of noscitur a socis.,ARG_PETITIONER
"Mr.Sridharan relied on the Apex Court in Gordhandas Tokersey, Pardeep Agarbatti and G.Radhakrishna Murti (supra).",ARG_PETITIONER
He submitted that the principle must be applied even when interpreting an entry containing two or more terms.,ARG_PETITIONER
"In this behalf, he relied upon Bennion on Statutory interpretation, 5th Edition at page 1197.",ARG_PETITIONER
Mr.Sridharan further submitted that the terms 'culinary and flavouring' is used only as a composite expression i.e. two words wherein one gives meaning to the other and there is no specific reason as to why the terms are used separately.,ARG_PETITIONER
"Mr.Sridharan submitted that this Court in the case of Commissioner of Sales Tax V/s.
Khosla Kesharwala reported in (2006) 145 STC 57 (Bom.) also indicates that a classification under entry C-II-78 requires the impugned product to predominantly relate to cooking as a colouring and flavouring agent.
 8.  ",ARG_PETITIONER
"In effect, Mr.Sridharan submitted that only those products which are in relation to culinary i.e. used in a kitchen which are covered under C-II-78.",ARG_PETITIONER
"The impugned product i.e.
 flavouring essence is not used directly in a kitchen or in cooking or any other similar manner, but used as raw materials in industries such as pharmaceuticals, confectionery products.",ARG_PETITIONER
"He submitted that this aspect has been considered by the Tribunal in its judgment on 31st March, 2006 in paragraphs 7 to 9.",ARG_PETITIONER
"For all these reasons, it is submitted that the impugned product does not fall within entry C-II-78 but falls under C-I-19.
 9.",ARG_PETITIONER
" With reference to the third question, Mr.Sridharan submitted that it is relevant only in the matter of S.H. Kelkar, Respondent in Sales Tax Reference No.47 of 2006 and others.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
 In that case, he submitted that the limited question is whether the impugned product determined as perfumery compound is found to be falling within entry C-I-19 and hence not under entry C-II-86 dealing specifically with perfumes other than those covered under C-I-19.",ARG_PETITIONER
"Mr. Sridharan submits that the test of common commercial / trade parlance has to b applied in interpreting schedule entries pertaining to classification, relying upon the judgments of the Supreme Court in Chemical and Fibres of India Ltd.",ARG_PETITIONER
V/s. Union of India reported in (1997) 2 SCC 664 and Ramavatar Budhaiprasad V/s.,ARG_PETITIONER
"Asst. Sales Tax Officer, Akola reported in (1961) 12 STC 286 in support of his contention.",ARG_PETITIONER
He further submitted that the specification and standards prepared by the Bureau of Indian Standards as published have been considered strong indicators of commercial and consumer parlance and glossaries published by the Indian Standards Organization have been relied by Courts in various judgments.,ARG_PETITIONER
"
 10.  In support of his contention, he placed reliance upon the decision of Chemical and Fibres of India Ltd.(supra), Warden & Co. V/s. CCE, Thane reported in (1995 Suppl. 1 SCC 740 and CCE, Kanpur V./s. Krishna Carbon reported in (1989) 1 SCC 150.",ARG_PETITIONER
"He further submitted that as per the Indian Standard Glossary of terms relating to natural and synthetic perfumery material, the term 'perfumery compound' has been specifically defined as a concentrated base which is further diluted and modified to suit various end uses.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
 'Perfume' has been distinctly defined as a solution of perfumery compound in ethanol or other suitable solvent meant for use as a personal adornment.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
 11.  Mr.Sridharan further submits that there is a distinction between perfumery compound and perfume which clearly indicates that both terms are to be treated distinctly in commercial or trade parlance, therefore, it is submitted that perfume /fragrance cannot fall within entry relating to perfumes C-II-86, the product will remain classified under C-I- 19.",ARG_PETITIONER
Mr.Sridharan and Mr. Patkar further submitted that the entry relating to perfumes under the Bombay Sales Tax Act prior to 1981 (E-I-19) is specifically interpreted in the case of CST V/s.,ARG_PETITIONER
"Gordhandas Tokersey reported in (1983) 52 STC 381, using the principle of noscitur a sociis to refer to preparations as are commonly known in market for use on the body as perfumes.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
 12.  This interpretation was referred in Pandurang Agarbatti V/s.",PRE_RELIED
"State of Punjab reported in [1997] 107 STC 56 and G.Radhakrishna Murti & Co. & Ors. V/s.
 ",PRE_RELIED
"CFTO, Vijaywada reported in [1999] 113 STC 161 (SC).
 ",PRE_RELIED
"The entry being interpreted in the above mentioned decisions is similar to the entry C-II-86 dealing with perfumes, therefore, what is covered by entry C-II-86 are those goods commonly used directly on the human body.",ANALYSIS
It is an undisputed fact that the impugned products are not used directly on the human body and are used in various industries for the purpose of respective end products.,ANALYSIS
"The revenue itself has accepted that the impugned products were sold to various manufacturers of soaps, cosmetics, agarbattis, etc.",ANALYSIS
The impugned products therefore cannot fall within entry C-II-86.,ANALYSIS
"
 13.  Mr.Sridharan submitted that in G.Radhakrishna (supra), the Apex Court had held that the meaning of the word 'perfume' in modern times has undergone a change, observing that the etymological meaning or the original meaning of 'perfume' may come from the word 'fumare' (smoke), but in modern parlance it has undergone a change.",ARG_PETITIONER
"The word 'perfume' orginates from the word 'fumare' which means smoke or to emit vapour,",ARG_PETITIONER
These are the meaning given by the Oxford Dictionary.,ARG_PETITIONER
The word 'Perfume' is also considered in Gordhandas Tokersey (supra).,ARG_PETITIONER
"In that case, the Court observed that when two or more words which are capable of being understood in an analogous manner are coupled together, they should be understood in the common analogous sense and not in a general sense.",ARG_PETITIONER
By applying this principle the Court held that 'perfume' in C-I-19 referred to such preparation as they are commonly known in the market for use on the body as perfumes.,ARG_PETITIONER
"Mr.Patkar, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioners in the Writ Petitions relied upon the judgment of this Court in Gordhandas Tokersey (supra) and adopted the submissions of Mr.Sridharan.",ARG_PETITIONER
"
 14.  Mr.Sridharan further submits that it is well accepted that in cases of classification, the burden of proof is placed on the revenue which must be discharged in order to sustain an assessment as valid.",ARG_PETITIONER
"In this behalf, he relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Hindustan Ferodo Vs. CCE reported in 1997 (89) ELT 16(SC) and Union of India V/s.
 Garware Nylons reported in (1996) 10 SCC 413.",ARG_PETITIONER

         The Judgment of the Court was delivered by- BHAGWATI, J.",NONE
The appellant and one Mohd. Yusuf Gulam Mohd. were charged for an offence under s. 379 read with s 34 of the Indian Penal Code for snatching two sarees from one Govind whilst he was carrying them from the show of his master to that of a washer and dyer.,FAC
"The learned Presidency Magistrate, who tried the case, accepted the prosecution evidence and found the appellant and Mohd. Yusuf Gulam Mohd.
guilty of the offence under s. 379 read with s. 34 andSentenced each of their to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months.",RLC
"It does not appear from the judgment of the learned Presidency Magistrate that, though the appellant was only seventeen years and three months old at the date of the offence and the offence was not punishable with imprisonment for life",FAC
", the attention of the learned presidency Magistrate was invited to the provisions of s. 6 of the Probation of offenders Act, 1958.",FAC
The appellant preferred an appeal against the order of conviction and sentence to the High Court of p Bombay but the appeal was unsuccessful.,FAC
The High Court took the same view of the evidence as the learned Presidency Magistrate and confirmed the conviction of the appellant under s. 379 read with s. 34.,RLC
"So far as the question of sentence was concerned, a submission was made on behalf of the appellant that since he was a young boy of about seventeen years and three months and this was his first offence, leniency should be shown tow him.",FAC
"But the High Court r observed that age alone was not sufficient to invoke the mercy of the Court and the appellant had not done anything since the date of the offence to deserve the mercy of the Court and it did not, therefore, see any reason to interfere with the sentence of imprisonment passed against the appellant.",RLC
"It appears that once again the provisions of s. 6 of the Probation of offenders Act, 1958 were not specifically brought to the notice of the High Court and the sentence of imprisonment was maintained by the High Court without applying its mind to those provisions.",FAC
"Hence the appellant preferred a petition for special leave to this Court and on that petition, this Court granted special leave limited to the question ""whether the provisions of the Probation of offenders Act should have been applied in the case"".",FAC
"We are concerned in this appeal with s. 6 of the Probation of offenders Act, 1958, for it is only under that section that the appellant claims the benefit of the provisions contained in the Act.",ANALYSIS
"Subsection (1) of s. 6, on a plain grammatical reading of its language, provides that when any person under twenty-one years age is found guilty of having committed an offence punishable with imprisonment, but not with imprisonment for life, the Court, by which the person is found guilty, shall not impose any sentence of imprisonment, unless it is satisfied that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender it would not be desirable to deal with himhim under s. 3 or s. 4.",STA
"This inhibition on the power of the Court to impose a sentence of imprisonment applies not only at the state of trial court but also at the stage ""High court or any other Court when the case comes before it on appeal or in revision.'.",ANALYSIS
"Vide s. 11, sub-s. (1) of the Act.",ANALYSIS
"
It is, therefore, obvious that even though the point relating to the applicability of s. 6 was not raised before the learned Presidency Magistrate or the High Court, this Court is bound to take notice of the provisions of that section and give its benefit to the appellant, particularly since it is a section which is intended for the benefit of juvenile delinquents, reflecting the anxiety of the Legislature to protect them from contact or association with hardened criminals in jails and retrieve them from a life of crime and rehabilitate them as responsible and useful members of society.",ANALYSIS
"
 Here, we find that whatever date be taken as the relevant date for determining the applicability of s. 6- whether the date of the offence or the date of the judgment of the learned Presidency Magistrate or the date of the judgment of the High Court-the appellant was below twenty one years age.",ANALYSIS
The offence of which he is found guilty is an offence under s. 379 read with s. 34 and it is clearly an offence punishable with imprisonment but not with imprisonment for life.,ANALYSIS
"The conditions requisite for the applicability of s. 6 are, therefore, plainly satisfied and under s. 6, Sub-s. (1) it is not competent to the Court to impose ant sentence of imprisonment on the appellant, unless the Court is satisfied that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the offence and the character of the appellant, it would not be desirable to deal with him under s. 3 or s. 4.",ANALYSIS
"It is true that sub-s. (2) of s. 6 requires that for the purpose of satisfying itself whether it would not be desirable to deal with the appellant under s. 3 or s. 4, the Court is required to call for a report from the Probation officer and consider the report, if any, but we do not think it necessary in the present case to call for any report from the Probation officer nor to remand the case to the learned Presidency Magistrate for passing an appropriate order after calling for a report from the Probation officer and considering it.",ANALYSIS
"
We have on record the antecedent history giving the background of the appellant.",ANALYSIS
The appellant was at one time a well known child film actor and he actually won several awards for acting in films.,ANALYSIS
It appears that at some subsequent stage he fell in bad company and took to evil ways,ANALYSIS
"The offence which he is convicted is, no doubt, an offence as theft which cannot be lightly ignored, but it is comparatively of a minor characters in that only two sarees were snatched away from the hands of Govind, perhaps under the stress of economic necessity.",RATIO
"Moreover, this is a false offence of the appellant.",RATIO
"We are, therefore, not at all satisfied 12-L925SupCI/75that it would not be desirable to deal with the appellant under s. 3 or s. 4 and consequently, the sentence of imprisonment passed on the appellant must be set aside.",RATIO
"
 We accordingly set aside the sentence of imprisonment passed on the appellant and direct that he be released on his entering into a bond wit one surety in the sum of Rs.
500/ to appear in the Court of the Presidency Magistrate to receive sentence, whenever called upon to do so within a period of six months and during that period to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.",RPC
The learned Presidency Magistrate is directed to take the necessary bond from the appellant and the necessary surety bond from a surety to his satisfaction.,RPC

"Out of these 6 comparables excluded by DRP, one comparable ICRA Techno Analytics Ltd. is having RPT in excess of 15% and therefore, for this reason alone, this comparable has to be excluded although DRP has excluded it for a different reason that it is having various activities and segmental data are not available.",ANALYSIS
We uphold its exclusion on account of RPT filter.,ANALYSIS

"On the other hand, the appeals of the present tenor as to whether the comparables have been rightly picked up or not, Filters for arriving at the correct list of comparables have been rightly applied or not, do not in our considered opinion, give rise to any substantial question of law.",ANALYSIS

 56. We are therefore of the considered opinion that the present appeals filed by the Revenue do not give rise to any substantial question of law and the suggested substantial questions of law do not meet the requirements of Vs. M/s. Commscope Networks (India) Pvt. Ltd., 13/14 Section 260-A of the Act and thus the appeals filed by the Revenue are found to be devoid of merit and the same are liable to be dismissed.

"We make it clear that the same yardsticks and parameters will have to be applied, even if such appeals are filed by the Assessees, because, there may be cases where the Tribunal giving its own reasons and findings has found certain comparables to be good comparables to arrive at an `Arm's Length Price' in the case of the assessees with which the assessees may not be satisfied and have filed such appeals before this Court.",ANALYSIS
Therefore we clarify that mere dissatisfaction with the findings of facts arrived at by the learned Tribunal is not at all a sufficient reason to invoke Section 260-A of the Act before this Court.,RATIO
